Editor  note: This story about former Harrisburg Mayor Stephen R. Reed  efforts to collect artifacts for various museums he envisions in the city was originally published June 4, 2015, when Reed was under investigation by a grand jury. He would later be indicted and Monday pleaded guilty to the theft about 20 artifacts. Like Ahab with his white whale, ex-Harrisburg Mayor Stephen R. Reed has long been obsessed with historical artifacts, a vexation that played a key role in his political undoing and now appears to be part of criminal investigation into his time in office. For much of his 28 years as mayor, a visit to Reed  dimly-lit City Hall office meant two things: Encountering a thick haze of cigarette smoke and being surrounded by a bevy of Civil War, Native American and Old West artifacts, which were crammed into both the mayor  conference room and his private quarters. Reed made no secret of his obsession for all things Civil War, Native American and Western. Yet, the multi-million-dollar artifact collections he amassed using public funds from the Harrisburg Authority, the city  bond-making and utility-owning arm, were conducted largely behind the scenes, if not in total secrecy. It became no secret that Reed also possessed a more modest private collection of artifacts, which he kept at his Cumberland Street rowhome. On Tuesday, nearly a dozen investigators raided Reed  midtown home and could be seen taking away saddles, a totem pole, what looked like a stuffed fox, a whiskey barrel and assorted other items, Eric Veronikis reported. Full coverage: Stephen Reed, charged with 100s of criminal counts, at the root of Harrisburg  fiscal issues, says AG Kane  On Wednesday, an ailing Reed, who says he is suffering from stage 4 cancer that started in his prostate, broke his near total silence since being turned out of office in 2009, proclaiming that all of the artifacts in his home belonged to him. Reed didn't elaborate, saying he was bound by a gag order related to the Office of the Attorney General  grand jury investigating Harrisburg  incinerator bond deal fiasco. Reed appeared before the panel in April. But the then-mayor confronted the artifact issues head-on in a March 2009 interview conducted as he was preparing to mount a bid for his eighth term in office. Stung by the artifact backlash, as well as rising city deficits and service cuts related to runaway spending on the deeply indebted incinerator renovation, Reed would lose the Democratic primary to then-City Council President Linda Thompson. He quietly left office at the end of 2009, and has remained mostly mum ever since. But in March 2009, as Reed was attempting to reassure voters, who for the first time seemed to be questioning his judgment, the mayor had this to say:  Never have I kept city- or authority-owned anything at my house, other than my pager. There are in the city government center different artifacts, some of them are in this room  his city office, where he pointed to an Indian buffalo head dress and several bound volumes on a table behind his desk.  Some city archival items are hanging out in the atrium; some are in the display cases downstairs; and some are in storage here. That  not many. The overwhelming majority of artifacts are in storage.  His reassurances, however, would not be enough. Not by a long shot. Winning the Civil War The North won the Civil War, and then 130 years later Steve Reed attempted to purchase it in Harrisburg. Throughout the 1990s, Reed amassed thousands of Civil War items from both North and South, including the hat box for Abe Lincoln  famous stovepipe, if not the hat, itself. The money came largely from bond fee proceeds and other non-tax funds from the Harrisburg Authority. The authority  board, which R   eed hand-picked in those days, funneled the money into a  special projects fund  that financed tens of millions in artifact spending in the 1990s and 2000s.  Reed  gambit was this: The literally thousands of artifacts he would hastily hand-pick at retail dealers from Gettysburg to Arizona would become the city  local matching funds toward the building of state-financed museums in Harrisburg. This was the very formula Reed used to build the National Civil War Museum in Reservoir Park, which opened in 2001. The $33.2 million project was split among the money Reed spent on literally thousands of Civil War artifacts, many of which remain stored away in the bowels of the museum, and state funds to build the place. Reed spent more than $17 million on those artifacts, at the state put in $16.2 million for construction. All told, Reed planned five museums for Harrisburg, including an African-American history museum, a sports hall of fame on City Island and perhaps most famously, a Wild West museum in decidedly eastern Harrisburg. Only the Civil War museum and the much smaller-scale National Fire Museum, ever became reality. Reed  ambitious - some would say, fool-hardy - artifact-spending for museums began to unravel in 2003, when word of Reed  prodigious spending on Western and Native American artifacts first surfaced in a July 6 front-page story in the Sunday Patriot-News. The scoop detailed at least $4.8 million  and counting  in Western artifact spending and unveiled Reed  plan for a National Museum of the Old West. Reed said that nearly all of the $4.8 million came from underwriting fees charged to borrowers who use the Harrisburg Authority, the independent bond-issuing agency which funds or refinances public projects - and not taxpayer dollars. Reed explained that Harrisburg Authority fees cannot be spent on city services such as police, fire protection, or any other operating expenses. The money must be spent on  capital purchases  - long-term investments which, Reed said, would include purchases for a city museum. All these facts came to light only after an artifact dealer in Arizona contacted the Patriot-News with questions about the Harrisburg mayor spending wildly on Western artifacts during trips all over Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and beyond. Reed had become instantly recognizable among antiques dealers and collectors in Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana, Wyoming and California. And dealers said he was known for paying top dollar and almost never haggling over price. One skeptical dealer, stunned by the money Reed was spending in Colorado Springs - as well as the mayor  practice of dispatching an armed city police officer to collect his finds -- began raising questions:  It made me wonder,  Jack Johnson, a dealer at Cadillac Jack  Trading Post in Calhan, Colo., told the Patriot-News in 2003.  Money  not an object for your mayor. He  buying stuff all over. I've never seen this in 20 years here.  A Wells Fargo stagecoach purchased by then-Harrisburg Mayor Stephen Reed is one of the many items auctioned by Heritage Auctions in Dallas in November 2007. Provided imageProvided image  Pressed with these facts, Reed confirmed the spending in an interview, during which he released a list of his purchases six pages long and agreed to answer questions about his museum plans. His treasures included extensive collections on Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, as well as a complete Wells Fargo wagon. This would grow to become a 10,000-item Western collection owned by Harrisburg, for which Reed paid $8.3 million. But one thing the city collection would not include was the $3,248 purchase at Cadillac Jack . Reed promptly cancelled the order after the owner ratted him out. At the time, Reed said his idea for a Wild West museum should have come as no surprise:  I've repeatedly stated over the years the long-standing plan, as part of the city  overall economic development program, is to create national, first-class facilities to attract and retain business, jobs, residents and visitors,  Reed said. But why a Western museum in Harrisburg?  Why not?  Reed asked. Why not, indeed. The Backlash Begins Fred Clark, then a member of the Harrisburg Authority board that approved Reed  artifact spending, famously dubbed Reed as  the Walt Disney of our time in central Pennsylvania.  But not everyone in Harrisburg saw it this way. Jason Smith, then-owner of the marketing firm Fathom Design Group on North Second Street, saw Reed  Wild West museum idea as patently absurd, and the ad man used his gifts for words and images to subvert the proposal with biting humor and subversive wit, beginning in the fall of 2003. Smith began by launching a website with slogans like,  Just say 'neigh' to the Wild West Museum  and  Give the Wild West Museum the boot.  He would show up at City Council meetings, asking,  Why are we buying Annie Oakley  underpants?  And by 2005, Smith would be running for mayor against Reed. Among his campaign trinkets were Reed finger puppets, with Harrisburg   cowboy mayor  decked out in a Stetson hat and leather chaps. Smith would lose the election by a 3-to-1 margin, but the public relations damage was done. And Reed knew it. Jason SmithJohn Luciew  Knocked off balance, Reed tried to recover by first putting his Wild West museum plans on hold in early 2004, then scrapped the idea altogether in fall 2006. He reluctantly agreed to begin selling off the now-10,000-item Western collection. But it was too late in many ways. Ironically, the closest Reed ever came to realizing his vision of a Wild West museum was the lavish display of all of his best artifacts put on by a high-brow auction house in Dallas, Texas. Heritage Auctions did right by the collection, producing glossy catalogs with professional pictures and lavish descriptions of each impressive piece. Then all of the best artifacts were put on display in a football-field-sized exhibition hall in Dallas, where they were auctioned off to the highest bidder over a weekend of bidding. There were pistols under glass; a pyramid-shaped display of cowboy boots and saddles; a caravan of stage coaches and wagons; a table of Indian moccasins; a wall of rare photos and art; and a range of rare rifles. All of it was carefully arranged, dramatically lit and imaginatively presented - a glimpse of the Western museum that might have been.  I think he definitely had a vision in mind when he assembled this collection,  said Rawhide Johnson, a Western artifacts specialist from Cody, Wyo.  It  impressive,  he said.  You can kind of get the idea of what the museum would have been like. I think he probably could be rated as a great visionary for what he tried to do.  Alas, Reed did not travel to Dallas to see it. He cancelled his trip at the last minute, citing city business. In the end, the Dallas auction and several subsequent city artifact sales recouped only a fraction of the $8 million-plus Reed spent on them. For example, the 2,914 guns, wagons, documents and old photos sold at the much-ballyhooed Dallas auction netted only $1.66 million - far short of the $8.3 million Mayor Stephen R. Reed spent acquiring the collection. Worse, the city  cataloging and storage of the items - most of which were crammed into a dusty warehouse by the city  trash incinerator - proved far less than ideal. The gold and silver, diamond-adorned sword of General Ulysses S. Grant is shown at the Heritage Auction Galleries in Dallas on June 15, 2007. The sword that was presented to Grant by the citizens of Kentucky in 1864 was part of an auction of Civil War-era items acquired by then-Harrisburg Mayor Stephen Reed that took place in June 2007.  AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez Tony Gutierrez  During his stint on the Harrisburg Authority board, current mayor Eric Papenfuse tried to make sense of the city  artifact inventory, attempting to match invoices with the items and track the authority  payment approvals and the current location for each item - only to be thoroughly frustrated and infuriated by incomplete or missing data. Aside from the Civil War and Western artifacts, Reed had acquired numerous other items purportedly for the  city archives.  Among them: a Sumerian bead necklace, Egyptian mummy items, a vampire kit, money from the French Revolution, World War II items and the like. As a result, Papenfuse, after copying all of the authority  artifact records, made a public call for a criminal investigation in Sept. 2007. By 2009, as Papenfuse was making a failed bid for City Council and Reed was running for re-election to an eighth term, Pepenfuse publicly stated that the FBI was investigating Reed  artifact spending and the way those purchases were handled and funded. Papenfuse said he knew this because he had been questioned by the Feds and had even been given a code name. The FBI, as is their custom, would neither confirm nor deny an investigation. But Reed, in his March 2009 interview, blasted the assertion.  I don't know what they would be investigating,  Reed responded.  A lot of artifacts were purchased. They were purchased for museum projects and the city archives. And it  all a matter of public record.  A method to his madness? Another troubling aspect of Reed  artifact spending was the seemingly arbitrary manner in which he amassed such a vast and costly collection, paying full retail prices at high-ticket tourist shops in well-traveled Western cities and towns. In collecting for the Wild West museum, Reed would travel, either alone or with his friend and one-time city employee, John Lavenda. According to one dealer in Colorado Springs, the mayor simply breezed into a shop and then proceeded to spend thousands of dollars in a matter of minutes. After taking the oath of office, Harrisburg Mayor Eric Papenfuse greets and talks with attendees at the Martin Luther King Jr. City Government Center. Papenfuse, in 2007, called for an investigation of then-Mayor Stephen Reed  spending on Civil War and Wild West artifacts. Dan Gleiter | dgleiter@pennlive.comDan Gleiter | dgleiter@pennlive.  After picking out his loot, Reed would leave behind his mayor  business card, instructing the dealer to mail out an invoice. In reply, the Harrisburg Authority would cut a check. Reed  purchases were then crated up, but not shipped. Instead, Reed would dispatch a city employee and an armed Harrisburg police officer to fly out West, rent a truck, pick up the treasures and drive them back to Harrisburg. On one such journey, the city employee and police officer spent two weeks making pick-ups in four Western states. Reed said this practice saved money on the professional armored transport that would otherwise be required for some of the more valuable items. When Reed didn't find what he was looking for, he would leave behind handwritten wish lists with shopkeepers. For artifact dealers, these lists were like wanted posters, offering rewards in the form of top-dollar sales for the dealer who can locate the items. In wake of the details about Reed  artifact-finding trips, some city officials raised questions about the travel, meal and personal reimbursement expenses Reed and others had put in for. They cited missing receipts, inadequate details and reimbursement forms submitted long after the trips and purchases were completed. Reed also submitted for reimbursement from the authority expenses for artifacts that he bought with his own money over the years. In the 2009 interview, Reed defended these practices:  They weren't personal items. They were items that I had purchased for the archives and museum projects. They were delivered here  to the city  from the very beginning. They were never anywhere else but delivered here. I didn't sell anything to the authority or the city. I got reimbursement for exactly what I paid to get those items. Not one penny more.  As for working with a professional curator or consultant in acquiring artifacts, Reed had tried that approach with in amassing his Civil War collection -- and it came back to bite him. Russell Pritchard III had advised Reed on his Civil War artifact purchases and sold items to Reed for the museum. But it turned out that Pritchard, who was an occasional volunteer appraiser for PBS   Antiques Roadshow,  was staging phony appraisals and defrauding Civil War collectors, according to the FBI. After the FBI probe, Pritchard was ordered to pay $830,000 in restitution - most of it to descendants of Confederate Gen. George Pickett, who alleged that Pritchard, then a buyer for The National Civil War Museum, bought military antiques from Pickett  family for $87,000 in 1995, only to sell them to the museum for $870,000. A jury had awarded the family more than $800,000 in damages in 1999. And when Pritchard was given access to photograph Harrisburg collection, he switched a soldier  jacket valued at more than $30,000. It would finally be returned five years later. Said Reed at the time:  Pritchard violated our trust; he violated the law. They stole from others through fraudulent actions and put a taint on Civil War artifact preservation in this nation.  Perhaps it was no coincidence then that when it came to collecting his Wild West artifacts, Reed would go it alone. A Visionary  Lament  In his confessional March 2009 interview, as the then-mayor was preparing to face Harrisburg voters a final time, Reed expressed rare regret for his artifact obsession:  The biggest mistake that I made was not securing broad community buy-in to the plan to create nationally scaled museum facilities clustered in Harrisburg, Pa. It wasn't that there was any secret about it, but there wasn't any broad community process where everything was unveiled at one time, input invited, and so forth and so on. In retrospect, it would certainly be done differently... The genesis of all of this was the concept of Harrisburg becoming a much bigger player in ... the tourism business.  In the end, however, the past has always been prologue for Steve Reed. So as law enforcement agents hauled artifact after artifact from the ailing ex-mayor  home this week, one couldn't help but wonder whether this marked Reed  last round up.❤By David DeKok             | HARRISBURG, Pa.  		 HARRISBURG, Pa. A sweeping corruption case against a former mayor of Pennsylvania’s capital city Harrisburg ended on Monday when he pleaded guilty to 20 counts of receiving stolen artifacts bought with public funds for a proposed museum that was never built in the city.Former Mayor Stephen R. Reed, 67, made the plea on the morning when jury selection in his trial was scheduled to begin in Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas. As part of the plea deal, prosecutors dropped 94 other counts.Reed, who was originally charged in 2015 with nearly 500 criminal counts, could receive up to nine months in prison under state sentencing guidelines when Judge Kevin Hess sentences him on Friday, although he may only get probation.Many of the more serious charges, including bribery and siphoning money from bond issues, were dismissed last year on statute of limitations grounds.  Today’s guilty plea marks the final chapter in a case that has gone on for several years,  said Deputy Attorney General Rebecca Frantz.  This will help the city of Harrisburg to move on.                           Reed, known as an avid private collector of Civil War and American West memorabilia during his 28 years in office, pleaded guilty to illegal possession of 20 historical documents and photographs with a total value of more than $18,000. The artifacts were among thousands acquired by Reed with public funds for a proposed Museum of the American West that he had hoped to build in financially strapped Harrisburg.After his plea, Reed told reporters he experienced  gut-wrenching humiliation and embarrassment  over his arrest, after serving as Harrisburg’s mayor for decades.                          He said many of the artifacts seized from his home and warehouse during a raid in 2015 were legally owned by him, but similar to ones acquired with public funds for the museum.He believes the 20 items in the plea were accidentally placed in boxes of his own papers after he hastily left office following his defeat in 2010, but acknowledged the packing was done under his supervision.                           The precepts of my faith require that I take responsibility for this error, and that was my ultimate deciding factor in doing this plea,  Reed said.A hearing is scheduled in March on Reed’s petition for the return of artifacts he believes belong to him. Frantz said prosecutors would oppose that request.Harrisburg has been under state financial supervision since 2011, primarily because of cost overruns on an incinerator retrofit project.

The number of people defrauded in the UK by online dating scams reached a record high in 2016, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has learned.  According to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, there were 3,889 victims of so-called romance fraud last year, who handed over a record £39m.  Action Fraud, the UK  cyber-crime reporting centre, says it receives more than 350 reports of such scams a month.  One woman who lost more than £300,000 says she felt emotionally  brutalised .  Nancy - not her real name - is 47, and a single mother from North Yorkshire, who runs her own business.  In 2015, after her marriage broke down, she signed up to dating site Match.com.  After a few days she made contact with someone calling himself Marcelo from Manchester, an attractive Italian who was working in Turkey, with whom she had  a rapport and similar values .   Marcelo  soon persuaded Nancy to move their chat off the dating website and on to an instant messaging service. The two began exchanging messages from morning till night.  After about six weeks, Marcelo said he had been mugged in Turkey and was unable to pay his workers before returning to the UK, when he and Nancy were due to meet. He also said his son was in hospital and needed surgery.  Nancy said she was uncomfortable with the situation but ended up  reluctantly  sending 3,650 euros  £3,160 .   It escalated unbelievably quickly, so straight away it was the medical fees, then it was money for food, money needed to pay rent, money for taxes to get out of Turkey.   I wasn't comfortable, and then I got so far in I couldn't get myself out, and I didn't want to walk away having lost £50,000 or what-have-you, so you keep going in the hope that you're wrong and this person is genuine.   Nancy says she  now facing bankruptcy after having lost  over £300,000, maybe even over £350,000 .   That  really frightening, and the other aspect is that somebody  got inside your head, and they've just brutalised you emotionally. In some ways I'm not sure I'll ever recover from that.   Match.com says it provides regular advice on how to stay safe and suggests members keep conversations on the site  so that our customer care team can identify abnormal activity .  Figures from the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau show there were 2,824 reports of dating scams in 2013, with reported losses of £27,344,814.  In 2014, these rose to 3,295 reports and losses of £32,259,381.  In 2015, the number of people rose to 3,363, but the reported losses fell to £25,882,339. Both figures then rose the following year to their record highs.  Steve Proffitt, deputy head of Action Fraud, says each victim loses £10,000 on average.   A lot of the online dating fraudsters we know are abroad. They're in West Africa, Eastern Europe and it  very difficult for British law enforcement to take action against them in those jurisdictions.   Judith Lathlean, 68, a university professor living in Hampshire, fell victim to a fraudster when she tried online dating in 2015, using the website Parship.  She matched with a man calling himself John Porter from London, who said he was an interior designer. He said that he too was a Christian, and his profile emphasised honesty and trust.  But he contacted Ms Lathlean from what he said was a business trip in South Africa, claiming he had lost his passport and saying he would lose a contract as a result.   The emails started getting a bit frantic, and the phone calls - 'I'm really worried, I'll lose the contract and this is going to be awful because it  very valuable',  she said.   And I immediately, because I was so believing in him, said, 'Don't worry John, I can loan you some money'. There was a total eventually of £54,000 for that particular part of the scam.   Weeks later, John got in touch to tell Ms Lathlean he had £15.5m trapped in a safe deposit box in Amsterdam. He asked her to go and release it, and she agreed.   I met two people there, I was asked to take a handling fee. I didn't think anything of it. That was 16,000 euros  £13,800 , and then they took me into this room and they showed me a trunk, which had all these notes in - all in $100 bills.   The men were perfectly professional. I got a so-called receipt for the money I took as a management fee. They had an answer for everything.   Ms Lathlean estimates she lost a total of £140,000 through several scams by whoever John Porter was.  Parship said its security systems are constantly scanning for fake profiles, but added that in this case  communication was switched very quickly to outside the protected Parship platform, so the blocking facilities did not manage to prevent further contact with the scammer .  Prof Monica Whitty, a cyber-psychologist, says it is  not the case that stupid people fall for romance scams - they can be very clever .   The criminal talks to them morning, noon and night. They use email to send poetry, they use instant messenger to groom them, to talk to them, to keep them awake at night.   So they groom them until they're ready to give up money.   The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.❤A total of 3,889 victims were defrauded out of £39 million from online-dating fraud in 2016 according to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, the BBC reports.  Each victim loses £10,000 on average, the deputy head of the UK  cybercrime reporting centre Action Fraud told the BBC. And the number of victims has risen from 2,824 in 2013, figures from the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau show.  Masking as a love interest, the so-called  romance scam  fraudsters build up trust with their victims and then ask them for money  for a variety of emotive reasons,  Action Fraud says on its website.  By inventing scenarios they coerce their victims into sending over funds. Typical scenarios are that they need funds for a flight home as a military personnel based overseas, for surgery or other medical-related issues, or to fund a visit to see the victim, according to Action Fraud.  And they insist on communicating via instant messaging and texts instead of the website on which they find their victims, this is one of Action Fraud   tell-tale signs.   A single mother from North Yorkshire is now facing bankruptcy after losing more than £300,000. A fraudster she met on Match.com claimed he had been mugged and that his son needed surgery,  ... then it was money for food, money needed to pay rent, money for taxes to get out of Turkey.  she told the BBC.

Monday was spent cleaning up in Barnwell County after a tornado swept through Saturday.  The National Weather Service confirmed two storms in the area late Saturday afternoon. The EF-2 tornado swept through Barnwell State Park, taking down trees and damaging homes nearby. NWS confirmed a smaller EF-1 tornado in nearby Orangeburg County.  RELATED: See photos of damage in the lower Midlands.  The Barnwell County Emergency Management Division toured a dozen damaged homes around lunch Monday, but estimate around two dozen are in need of repair post-storm. Several nearby farms also suffered damage.  Along Highway 3, neighbors are calling an elderly woman lucky to be alive after her trailer was picked up from its foundation and flipped on its side. EMS managed to help her escape by cutting a hole in her roof.  Now, a nephew says she  staying with family after being released from the hospital, escaping with just a broken arm, a concussion, and some bruises. Her dog was also found safe and sound near the road just hours after the storm passed through.❤The National Weather Service has issued a coastal flood watch and high wind warning for the area, causing hazardous travel conditions on local roads Monday.  Rain is predicted to be heavy at times starting Monday morning through the evening, totaling about 2 inches. A coastal flood watch goes into effect Monday morning, with moderate coastal flooding predicted around high tide later in the evening.  “Numerous road closures may be needed,” the weather alert states. “Structural damage may be observed along the immediate shoreline.”  A high wind warning will also be in effect between 1 a.m. Monday and 1 a.m. Tuesday, with 30 to 40 mph northeast winds and wind gusts reaching up to 70 mph.  Power outages and fallen trees are expected as a result of the strong wings, which the NWS predicts will mostly take place late Monday morning and last until Monday night.
MIDDLETOWN, Ohio  WKRC  - Members of a church in Middletown are trying to pick up the pieces, after fire swept through the Tytus Avenue First Church of God.  Flames and smoke overnight, left the congregation searching for a place to worship on Sunday and many parents are now searching for a new daycare center, too.  You can see just how severely damaged the church is after the fire broke out early this morning.    The Middletown Fire Department was called out about 2:30 a.m. Sunday morning when a police officer saw smoke in the area and discovered the Tytus Avenue First Church of God was on fire.  The deputy chief says they are still investigating what caused the fire. Fortunately, nobody was hurt.  The pastor says much of the damage was to the educational wing and main daycare where building strong foundations learning center was located.   This is a family and so family responds they don't react they respond and we work to get our family back together and let everyone know everything is gonna be okay,  said Pastor Damon Curtis.  The director says they care for about 45 kids and now have to find a temporary location.   If there  another church that has a facility that they think would be good for a daycare and they could take us in temporarily that would be great. If there  another program that has room for 45 children and some staff to come in and help us out temporarily the church is planning on rebuilding so that would be wonderful,  said Beth Rettich.  The deputy chief says there was smoke damage throughout the church including the sanctuary. The pastor says they are still working to figure out where service will be held in the meantime.  The pastor says more than 100-people attend the church.  The Sunday service was still held Sunday morning but it in a gymnasium at  Poasttown First Church of God .❤Middletown fire crews were called to the Tytus Avenue First Church of God at 2:45 a.m. Sunday.  Firefighters reported smoke tearing through the roof and erupting through the night sky. Thirty fire personnel from Middletown and Monroe took about two hours to knock down the fire.  Watching emergency crews extinguish the blaze, Tytus Ave. pastor Damon Curtis said his congregation would go on in the midst of disappointment.   A building can be rebuilt. It  the people that occupy the building that are important,  Curtis said.   No injuries were reported, but the Sunday morning fire left the congregation sifting through the ashes with no place to worship.  Reverend Curtis reached out to neighboring pastor Kenny Brewer, of the Poastown Church. Brewer immediately answered the call of a neighbor in need.   I was in a sound asleep this morning when Pastor Curtis called me and said they had some bad luck. Their church had burned down,  Brewer said.  Hearing of the fire, the minister said he and his congregation did not hesitate to respond.   When the phone rang, I just said, 'Come on down.' That  what we are all about, helping one another. Even with different locations, we are still one family. When one hurts, we all hurt and we all pull together,  Brewer said.  Looking through the rubble of a burned out roof now opened towards the heavens, pastor Curtis reflects,   There'll be some folks who have known this building since it was built in the 80 . There'll be some grieving taking place, and we'll work with them. But together, we will move forward.

A witness managed to drag Seyoum from the flames and arriving Kalamazoo Public Safety officers were quickly able to put out the flames and begin medical care for the victim.  Seyoum was transported to Bronson Methodist Hospital but died from his injuries.  The other driver, a 74-year-old woman from Mattawan, was not injured but the crash remains under investigation. Her name is being withheld until a determination is made on whether she will be charged, but they say alcohol and drugs do not appear to be factors.
The  Grand Theft Auto  series is just shy of its thirtieth birthday. The first  GTA  game came out in October 1997, and it looked nothing like the series does today.  In fact, it wasn't until  Grand Theft Auto III  on PlayStation 2 that the series really exploded in popularity; that entry also set the standard by which all future  GTA  games would be measured. In many ways,  Grand Theft Auto V  — the latest entry in the long-running series — is the most recent iteration of a formula that began with  Grand Theft Auto III.   And that  not without reason: The same man was at the production helm for every  GTA  entry between 2001   GTA III  and  GTA V.  His name is Leslie Benzies, and he  a Scottish game designer.  Benzies is no longer employed by Rockstar Games  the company behind the  GTA  series  or its parent company  Take-Two Interactive . His employment ended at Rockstar, effectively, in September 2014. According to a lawsuit Benzies filed against Rockstar and Take-Two in April 2016, Benzies claims he was was  enticed by Rockstar  to take a sabbatical starting in September 2014. A little over a year later, in January 2016, Rockstar officially announced that Benzies was no longer with the company.  What happened in the interim depends on who you ask. It  a bit of a he said/she said — here  what we know:  Regardless, Benzies isn't waiting for his lawsuit to play out — he  getting back into the game industry on his own accord, having just registered several companies.  As The Scotsman noticed, Benzies registered a handful of different companies starting in January 2016 — soon after Rockstar Games confirmed that Benzies was no longer an employee. Those range from straightforward video game development studios   Royal Circus Games Limited,   Everywhere Game Limited   to more hardware-focused stuff   VR-Chitect Limited   — you can see the full listing of companies here on the UK  business registration site.  Of the several companies Benzies registered, only Benzies and one other employee are listed on each filing — a man named Christian Poziemski, who appears to be a financial adviser. Whether or not these companies are anything more than placeholder registrations is another question altogether. Given Benzies' prolific history in game development, we expect this is more than a just-in-case measure.  As for the lawsuit, Rockstar and its parent company Take-Two Interactive are refuting Benzies' claims, as well as counter-suing.❤It’s great to hear that any developer is getting into VR, but when the former President of Grand Theft Auto creator Rockstar North gets involved with the tech, we really pay attention. Leslie Benzies, producer on the influential gaming series, started up several new companies, and at least one of them is jumping into the VR game. As spotted by The Scotsman, Benzies is named as the co-Company Director on a 2016-filed Certificate of Incorporation document for VR-Chitect Limited. The role is shared by Christopher Poziemski, former Assistant Director at financial planning firm Brewin Dolphin. Based in Edinburgh, Scotland, where GTA games themselves are made, the company appears to be making not VR content but instead its own headset. A listing at the Intellectual Property Office notes the company is working on a “Virtual reality system and method”. The US Patent and Trademark Office also reportedly has a listing for a system that “enables virtual reality viewing” from the company, though we were unable to locate it ourselves. If true, it suggests the company could be making its own VR hardware. We have no idea what to expect from the scale of these headsets; they could be anything from new Google Cardboard-like kits all the way up to new SteamVR-supported devices, or anywhere in between. The developer also has several other new companies, including Royal Circus Games Limited, Starship Group and Everywhere Game Limited. One of them appears to be working on a videogame named Time For A New World, which would be a nice label for a VR project, though there’s no indication that it is one. Benzies oversaw production of practically every GTA game since 2001’s iconic Grand Theft Auto III, including DLC content and spin-off games. He also worked on other Rockstar-published titles like Red Dead Redemption and L.A. Noire. He’s currently wrapped up in a legal battle with his former studio after leaving at the start of last year. The developer is suing Rockstar and owner Take-Two for $150 million, claiming he hasn’t been paid royalties for his time working at the studio.

The cause of the fire is currently under investigation.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched its investigation in June after a driver died in an accident that took place while his Tesla Model S was operating with Autopilot activated. The Model S passed under a truck and, finally, drove off the road because the Autopilot system was unable to differentiate between the white truck and bright sky to apply the brake.  NHTSA raised two keys points when clearing Tesla of any wrongful conduct.  One was that, as a Level 2 self-driving system, the burden was on the driver to monitor the system and interact – something the driver who died in this accident had enough time to do. The other thing was that Autopilot was unable to notice traffic crossing in front of the vehicle, so it was not defective when it didn’t apply the brake.  Thomas said that although Tesla releases a software update in September 2016, which the company claimed could have prevented the accident, it shouldn’t be seen as a “remedy.” Essentially, Autopilot was not defective by not applying the brake before hitting the truck, even though it still would do so in the same situation today because of the software update.  Still, the Tesla investigation says that in the future, an auto manufacturer may be able to avoid expensive recalls through software updates before investigations into potential defects.  NHTSA even declared that the Tesla update addressed some of its concerns about Autopilot in its report. This is something that most of the traditional automakers can’t currently do during an ongoing investigation because their vehicles are not able to receive wireless updates. Rather than, most car owners today have to take their vehicle to a dealer to get a software update.  Still, auto manufacturers are on the hook for a recall if a defect is found, even if a simple over-the-air update could fix it.  In the future, if a defect was noticed, it’s not enough to issue a software update, an actual recall has to be issued. And then that software update can take place.  Ultimately, the Tesla investigation highlights how the government will need to ensure that automakers are held responsible for defects, even if they can be fixed easily with software updates.❤Tesla Motors Inc  NASDAQ:TSLA ’s Autopilot system was the subject of a federal government investigation that began after a Model s driver died in an accident. The NHTSA launched its investigation following the incident in June, and on Thursday, it closed the investigation, saying it won’t issue any recall. Over-the-air updates could change the nature of recall Had the firm updated its software earlier, neither the accident would have taken place, nor the investigation. In this case, Tesla’s Autopilot failed to distinguish between a white truck the and bright sky, and didn’t apply the brakes. NHTSA, which closed the investigations, hinted that in some cases, if the firm is able to make cars safer with over-the-air updates, it will change the nature of recalls, says a report from Business Insider. When asked if NHTSA is considering changing the recall structure as over-the-air updates become more common, spokesperson Bryan Thomas replied, “Sure I think that’s something we will take a look at in the future.”         Tesla software was not defective Before clearing Tesla Motors Inc  NASDAQ:TSLA  of any wrongdoing, NHTSA made note of two things. First, when the Level 2 self-driving system was applied, it was supposed to be the driver’s responsibility to monitor the system and intervene, which the victim should have done but didn’t, despite having ample time for it.    Second, it was known that Autopilot was unable to detect traffic crossing in front of the vehicle, so it wasn’t the software’s defect/fault if it didn’t automatically apply the brake. Tesla did issue a software update in September 2016, claiming it to be capable of preventing this type of accident, but it shouldn’t be seen as a remedy, warned Thomas. Presumably, Autopilot would apply the brakes before the vehicle hits an obstacle if faced with a similar situation today, but that would be a result of the software update made after the accident. Hence, it was not defective.  Tesla investigation – what it means? One take-away from the Tesla investigation is – if automakers can dispatch over the air software updates they will avoid costly recalls, notes Business Insider. The Tesla Motors Inc  NASDAQ:TSLA  update addressed some of its concerns about Autopilot in its report, acknowledged NHTSA. This, however, is not possible for most traditional automakers to do as their vehicles are incapable of receiving updates wirelessly. In the future, if the NHTSA determines that issuing a software update could reduce the time required for a traditional recall, then it might change the way it handles defects, said Thomas. “These are questions the agency will have to deal with in the future, but we would very much like to move quickly toward that future,” Thomas said.          However, this does not free the automakers  at least for now  from the fear of a recall that might be forced to do so in case a defect is found even if it could be fixed with a simple over-the-air update.❤Just a few months after the federal government opened up its investigation into Tesla  Autopilot system, the electric carmaker released a software update that could have prevented the whole ordeal in the first place.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched its investigation in June after a driver died in an accident that occurred while his Tesla Model S was operating with Autopilot activated. The Model S passed under a truck and, ultimately, drove off the road because the Autopilot system was unable to distinguish between the white truck and bright sky to apply the brake.  NHTSA closed the investigation on Thursday and said it will not issue a recall.  But the government agency also hinted that there is room for the nature of recalls to change if over-the-air updates can make cars safer.   Sure I think that’s something we will take a look at in the future,  NHTSA spokesperson Bryan Thomas said when asked if NHTSA is considering changing the recall structure as over-the-air updates become more common. He added that such a change is not in the works right now.  NHTSA raised two keys points when clearing Tesla of any wrongdoing.  One was that, as a Level 2 self-driving system, the onus was on the driver to monitor the system and intervene — something the driver who died in this accident had ample time to do.

That  something most traditional automakers can't currently do during an ongoing investigation because their vehicles aren't capable of wireless updates. Instead, most car owners today have to take their vehicle to a dealer to get a software update.  In the future, NHTSA may change how it handles defects if it determines issuing a software update is faster than the recall process, Thomas said.   These are questions the agency will have to deal with in the future, but we would very much like to move quickly toward that future,  Thomas said.  Still, at least for now, automakers are still on the hook for a recall if a defect is found, even if a simple over-the-air update could fix it.   While we are getting to an era of being able to do over the air updates and correct problems as they arise, it doesn’t change the manufacturer  responsibility that if a defect has been identified they still have to file a 573 and issue a recall,  Thomas said.   In the future, if a defect was identified, it  not enough just to issue a software update, an actual recall has to be issued. And then that software update can happen,  he continued.  Ultimately, the Tesla investigation highlights how the government will need to race the clock to ensure automakers are held accountable for defects, even if they can be fixed easily with software updates.❤Allegedly, Tesla just released new software, which could have prevented the fatal car accident, which had occurred in June. The company was being investigated prior to the release of this software, in order to determine, the responsibility for said accident and safety of Tesla vehicles.  Despite what may or may not have occurred at the incident, it was clear that the NHTSA believes that the new software released by Tesla, will ensure that no such incident happens again. This was further emphasized when they announced that they would not be issuing a recall, and furthermore, the investigation against Tesla has officially been closed.  The incident in question, which led to the development of the latest released software into Tesla autopilot systems, as well as the investigation of Tesla, was a fatal car accident, which led to the death of a driver, who was making use of the Tesla autopilot system on his vehicle.  According to those, who are familiar with the matter, allegedly, the vehicles analytical software, was unable to distinguish between a white truck, and the bright sky, which led to the vehicle losing control and hurtling off of the road, fatally wounding the driver.  However, when questioned on liability for the accident, the company denied that it was the fault of their autopilot system. The company stated that the autopilot system  at that time  was known to be unable to do certain things, such as brake, while a vehicle was in front of it, amongst other things. However, this has changed, with the release of the new software.  All is not hollow, when it comes to this incident, as is may be the primary cause of the revolution of recall processes for various vehicle manufacturers, who are experiencing performance, or other issues with their vehicles.  Allegedly an NHTSA spokesman stated that they would be looking into fundamentally changing the recall process for vehicles, when over-the-air updates, such as the one Tesla recently made, which rectified safety hazard issues in their vehicles, becomes more common place.
As promised, Samsung has revealed the results of its investigation into the spate of Galaxy Note 7s that caught on fire.The big takeaway from the investigation is that the phone itself was fine—the quick-charging mechanism inside the phone and the USB-C connector had no role in the exploding phones. Instead, there were a number of problems when it came down to the batteries used inside the   	   						 	 		 			 Samsung will finally tell us why the Galaxy Note 7 exploded at a press conference on Sunday night…  			 				Read more Read  investigation included its internal team of 700 engineers and researchers that tested 200,000 devices and more than 30,000 batteries. Samsung also worked with three different groups, UL, Exponent, and TUV Rheinland, who all offered their own independent results.            The results come three and a half months after Samsung finally pulled the plug on the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. Beginning in late August, Galaxy Note 7s started to catch on fire. Samsung initially recalled the phone in September, before resuming production. After phones that were supposed to be “fixed” also started to catch on fire, Samsung expanded its federal recall to include all Note 7 devices and permanently ended production of the phone. The Galaxy Note 7 used two different battery manufacturers that Samsung simply referred to as “battery A” and “battery B.” Battery A was in the first group of recalled phones  before September  and battery B was for the second group of phones that exploded after the first recall.According to the results from Exponent, UL, and TUV Rheinland, the problem with the battery A was that there was a deformity on the upper-right corner, which caused the electrodes inside the battery to bend and then combust. Exponent also blames the bendiness on the battery itself being too large for the cell pouch designed to “accommodate the electrode  problem with battery B is a little different. The experts say there wasn’t a problem with the battery design itself, instead Exponent said the problem was determined to be “internal cell faulting between positive electrode tab welding defects and the copper foil of the negative electrode directly opposite the defective welds.” Those welding defects happened in the manufacturing process. Samsung blames the flaws on the fact that its factories were trying to get production started too quickly to counteract lost sales.               This more or less matches what The Wall Street Journal reported last week. It also echoes an earlier report from a startup called Instrumental, which determined that the pouch for the Note 7  battery was too small based on its own teardown of a unit sold before the first recall.Now what? It’s great that Samsung and its third-party experts can explain why the batteries caught on fire, but the real test will be whether consumers will trust Samsung to not make these sorts of mistakes in the future.            For me, the more egregious problem is actually the second battery, because its flaws were not born out of a design problem, but shoddy manufacturing standards when the company was in a rush to get products back on the market. Look, I get it, Samsung was in a bad situation after the first recall. It had a very popular phone that was not available for sale, plenty of angry customers who wanted a fixed phone, and a brand new iPhone 7 on the market to compete against.But that rush to getting production back up and running meant that corners were cut and that phones wound up exploding on airplanes. When the Galaxy S8 is introduced early this year, Samsung will need to do a solid job convincing the public that not only has it learned its lessons from a design perspective—but that it is prioritizing safety in manufacturing over the almighty dollar.❤The main culprit behind the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 fires was defective batteries, according to an internal investigation released by Samsung on Sunday.  The issue with the first version of the Note 7 -- with what Samsung calls  Battery A  -- was that the battery  negative electrode had a slight deflection, allowing the positive and negative electrodes to meet. And when that happens, fires start.  The second version of the Note 7 -- the second model came with a new battery from a different manufacturer that was supposed to resolve the issue -- showed that  Battery B  had abnormal welding burrs  slight bumps leftover by welding  on the positive electrode. The welding burrs caused direct contact between the positive tab with the negative electrode.  Where does the Samsung  fault lie in all of this? Even though Samsung found issue with the battery manufacturers, Samsung still picks and certifies its suppliers and then ultimately integrates this outside technology into its products and sells it to customers. Samsung promised it would try to better catch these issues ahead of time.   This is our device and our brand,  said Justin Denison, senior vice president of product strategy and marketing at Samsung, in an interview.  We're the ones that partner with our suppliers to set the specifications. That  where we take responsibility. Our process with respect to quality assurance and testing is extremely robust and exceeds industry standards, but it didn't catch the problems.   In response to the Note 7 problems, Samsung will introduce what it calls an  8 Point Battery Safety Check.  The eight steps include a durability test, visual inspection, an X-ray test, a charge and discharge test, a leak detection test, a disassembling test, an accelerated usage test, and then finally a test for comparing battery voltage.   Hindsight is always twenty-twenty, but Samsung could have predicted earlier on, given the battery aggressiveness, that they needed to implement the new eight point battery safety check and the new software algorithms,  said tech analyst Patrick Moorhead.  I believe the new battery board will give them clearer sight into future needs.   Samsung is now on an apology tour and releasing the investigation is its first attempt at making things right. For the investigation, Samsung said it contributed over 700 R&D staff and tested over 200,000 Note 7 devices and over 30,000 batteries. Samsung also brought in three outside companies -- UL, Exponent and TUV Rheinland -- to conduct their own investigations of the Note 7 defects.  Samsung said it  also trying to use the Note 7 incident as an opportunity to improve lithium-ion battery safety across every industry that makes use of the technology. It will contribute its investigation findings to industry standard boards.   I saw an opportunity to improve lithium-ion batteries, not only for Samsung but for other industries as well,  said Samsung mobile head Koh Dong-jin in an interview.  I think this is the best way to bring back customer trust.   The Note 7 debacle began soon after the phone launched last August to rave reviews -- --  arguably the best big phone ever made,  said the Verge. Soon after, reports that the phone caught fire began emerging. Samsung sent out a recall and replaced the phones with another version with a battery from different manufacture. That didn't appear to fix the problem as a fresh set of fire reports soon appeared -- including a Note 7 that started spewing smoke on a Southwest flight.  In October, the company finally ended production of the Note 7 and issued a recall of every device. So far the Note 7 has a 97% return rate, Samsung said. The incident could end hitting the company for at least $5.3 billion in operating profit.  In the end, only 1% of the over 3 million units sold were defective, Samsung said. But it is odd that Samsung found issues solely with the batteries when the two versions of the Note 7 came from two different manufacturers. Analyst Moorhead said this just points to the limits companies are reaching with the current state of lithium-ion battery technology.   We’ve hit an industry inflection point where we need new strategies and tactics to get even smaller batteries with more life inside even smaller devices,  said Moorhead.  This is an industry wake-up call for sure.   Follow me on Twitter @aatilley or send me an email: atilley@forbes.com❤Three months after its largest-ever recall, Samsung has finally completed its investigation of the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. The high-profile flagship phone was recalled  twice  and canceled after reports of explosions and fires, and now Samsung thinks it has finally nailed down the issue.  Samsung  verdict: two separate battery construction issues were to blame. Samsung Electronics used two separate suppliers for the Galaxy Note 7—Samsung SDI, a sister company in Samsung Group, and Amperex Technology Ltd  ATL —and it turns out both manufacturers had their own issues. Given that Samsung  first recall and attempted fix didn't work, it  no surprise that the problem behind the Galaxy Note 7 is a complicated one.  In its report, Samsung refers to the battery manufacturing partners in generic terms—possibly to help those partners save face. This  Battery A,   Manufacturer A  obfuscation really won't fool anyone who is paying attention, since Samsung identifies  Battery A  as  from the first recall,  and the first recall exclusively targeted batteries made by Samsung SDI.  Galaxy Note 7 review: What’s the opposite of “bang for your buck?” For the Samsung SDI batteries, Samsung  investigation determined that the corner of the battery casing was too small, which resulted in the negative electrodes in the corner of the battery being bent. This made it easier to short-circuit the battery and cause a  thermal runaway  situation where the battery explodes or catches fire. Exponent, one of the consulting companies in Samsung  investigation, said that this  unintended damage was present in all of the cells examined by Samsung and Exponent.  This means that in the first round of Galaxy Note 7s, nearly 100 percent of devices were defective.  Think of that as a one-more-time warning for the 4 percent of Note 7 customers who still haven't returned their devices.   We’re up to seven reports of “safe” Galaxy Note 7s exploding [Update #3] Samsung also identified an  additional contributing factor  with Battery A: the negative electrodes were too long, which led to them being bent in the curve on the long side of the battery.  With the first recall underway,  Battery B —which previous reports said was manufactured by ATL—was used in all the replacement Galaxy Note 7s. Battery B didn't have any of the Battery A defects; it had a defect all its own. When connecting the positive tab to the battery,  Manufacturer B   welding process—which Exponent called  poorly controlled —created high, sharp welding burrs. Normal expansion and contraction of the battery electrodes during charging and discharging caused the welding burrs to scrape against the insulation between battery layers. Eventually this scraping could penetrate the insulation and short out the battery, causing fireworks.  Another  additional contributing factor  to the failure of Battery B sounds rather alarming: some batteries were missing insulation tape. The tape helped reinforce certain trouble spots, and apparently ATL forgot to attach it to many units.  Samsung made a big deal out of just how large this investigation was, saying  approximately 700 Samsung researchers and engineers replicated the incidents by testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries.  In addition to Samsung  work, it also hired three outside consulting firms for help: Exponent consulting, the ubiquitous Underwriters Laboratories  UL , and TU¨V Rheinland.  Linked are their respective PDF reports.   Samsung says it has  reassessed every step of the smartphone manufacturing process  since the Note 7 recall and in response has come up with a new  eight-point  battery safety check process. The new process includes the same investigative techniques that helped solve the Note 7 defects, like the use of an X-ray machine and physically disassembling the batteries and looking for problems. Samsung has also  formed a Battery Advisory Group of external advisers, academic and research experts to ensure it maintains a clear and objective perspective on battery safety and innovation.  The product planning stage has changed, with Samsung promising an  improved battery design safety standard  with  brackets around the battery for protection  and  improved algorithms  for governing the battery.  Before announcing the findings, DJ Koh, president of Samsung Mobile, said,  I deeply apologize to all of our customers, carriers, retail and distribution partners, and all of our business partners.  So far, Samsung has admitted to a $5 billion loss in profits due to the widespread recall and cancellation of the Galaxy Note 7, with analysts estimating the revenue loss at $10 billion.❤The long and tumultuous story of the Galaxy Note7 smartphone finally has a conclusion now that Samsung has released the findings of its investigation into the exploding incidents that led to the device  recall.  At a press conference on Sunday, the Korean electronics giant produced the details of what exactly went wrong with the smartphone that initially received glowing reviews, but soon was buried in reports of explosion incidents.  Last week, some reports indicated that the findings would reveal problems with irregularly shaped batteries as the cause of the malfunctions and now Samsung  mobile chief DJ Koh has shed light on the specific cause of the malfunctions.  According to Samsung, problems were found in two different manufacturing situations, both involving different series of batteries.   The first series involved a battery casing that was too small, leading to what Samsung described as an  electrode deflection and incorrect positioning of the negative electrode tip in the upper right corner of the battery.    The second problem came about due to what Samsung says was an  abnormal weld spot,  a manufacturing problem that  led to an internal short circuit.   Missing insulation tape also contributed to problems with the second series of batteries .   DJ Koh, Samsung  chief of mobile.The findings come after the company conducted large-scale charge and discharge tests involving 700 engineers 200,000 devices and 30,000 batteries. The investigation covered manufacturing plants in China, Vietnam and South Korea.   Over the course of an hour, Samsung displayed detailed slides and video showing the lengths it went to in order to track down the problem, along the way pointing out other potential issues with manufacturing and quality control.   Along with its own investigation, Samsung also presented several outside parties at its press conference who also were tasked with tracking down issues with the Note7, including executives from consumer electronics safety groups UL, Germany  TUV Rheinland and Exponent.      And in an effort to further show that the battery explosions have been taken seriously by Samsung, the company also presented testimony regarding its testing efforts from chemistry and engineering professors from the University of Cambridge, UC Berkeley and Stanford University.  In order to address future battery safety issues, Samsung announced new measures to check the quality of batteries as well as the formation of a battery safety advisory group. The new measures will include  a broad range of internal quality and safety processes to further enhance product safety including additional protocols such as the multi-layer safety measures and 8-Point Battery Safety Check.    Samsung  new Battery Advisory Group will involve  external advisers, academic and research experts to ensure it maintains a clear and objective perspective on battery safety and innovation.   I believe Samsung did what it needed to do to start rebuilding trust with those who actually still care with the Note7 issue,  Patrick Moorhead, a technology industry analyst, said in a statement sent to Mashable.  I perceived that Samsung took overall responsibility even though it appears this is a supplier issue. The odds that two different suppliers had issue with the same phone is extremely low likelihood and may signal we may have reached an inflection point in smartphone battery technology.  All the details regarding how Samsung conducted its investigation into the Note7 are now posted on a special website the company launched on Sunday.❤Samsung Electronics says flaws in the design and production of batteries used in its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, not its hardware or software, made it prone to catch fire. Samsung said Monday that it was responsible for not ensuring the design specifications given to its suppliers were failsafe but believed its investigation into the problem would help the entire industry counter overheating risks with lithium batteries. Analysts questioned if the world  largest smartphone maker had really gotten to the bottom of the problem. The South Korean company delayed the launch of its next Galaxy phone--the Galaxy S8, which usually would come in February. It also announced tighter quality controls and more rigorous testing to ensure safety. During a two-hour press conference livestreamed in English, Chinese and Korean, Samsung said tests of more than 200,000 phones and 30,000 batteries showed different problems with each of the two kinds of batteries used in the Note 7. Some experts had speculated that the phones' ultra-thin design or water-resistant features could have made them prone to overheat. Koh Dong-jin, president of Samsung  mobile division, said the investigation found no such problems. The Galaxy Note 7 featured one of the biggest battery capacities so far for smartphones at 3,500 mAh, or milliampere hour, which gave it the highest energy density of all Samsung  devices. However, Koh said Samsung and outside inspectors found no evidence that the high energy density alone was to blame. Samsung introduced the Note 7 on Aug. 2 and weeks later recalled the first batch after reports emerged that the phones were overheating and in some cases exploding. After replacement phones also started catching fire, aviation authorities banned them on flights and the company dropped the product for good. It has estimated the quality control fiasco will cost it $5.3 billion through early this year. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing  787 jetliner. Manufacturers like the batteries because they weigh less and pack much more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. But rechargeable lithium batteries like those used in smartphones are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Having taken heat for failing to fix the problem after the first Note 7 recall in September, Samsung brought in three private inspectors to help. U.S. companies UL and Exponent examined batteries from Samsung  suppliers Samsung SDI and Amperex Technology Ltd., or ATL. The German company TUV Rheinland analyzed the Note 7 supply chain as part of the investigation. Inspectors found damage to the upper corners of batteries made by one manufacturer--likely Samsung SDI--and used in the initial batches of Note 7s. That, combined with overly thin separators and high energy density, caused the phones to overheat, Samsung said. The cell-pouch design of the battery also did not have enough space to safely accommodate its electrodes--another flaw. In other batches of batteries from a second manufacturer, presumably China-based ATL, used in replacements for the recalled smartphones the researchers found welding defects and a lack of protective tape in some battery cells. Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights  Strategy, said the odds of two different suppliers having issues with the same phone are extremely low. The case  may signal we may have reached an inflection point in smartphone battery technology,  Moorhead said. Samsung  latest findings were not that different from the ones announced after the first Note 7 recall, said Park Chul Wan, a former director of the next generation battery research center at the state-owned Korea Electronics Technology Institute.  Samsung said the weaknesses could make the phone prone to catch fire. That I understand but what did trigger fires in such conditions? Did they discuss if there is another cause? No,  said Park of the Korea Electronics Technology Institute. Though Samsung faulted the batteries from its suppliers, it said it would bear all costs from the Galaxy Note 7 debacle.  We are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing,  it said in a statement. It was unclear to what extent the battery makers were responsible for those problems since Samsung said only that it had provided  targets,  such as how thin the batteries should be and what their capacity should be. That may suggest a breakdown both in communication between Samsung and its suppliers and in quality control and testing.  We suggested that the Note 7 has innovations and a compact design and a 3500 mAh  battery  but we did not know how to make the separators within  the battery  or how many millimeters thick they should be,  Koh told reporters. He said Samsung would use what it learned from its investigations to improve lithium battery safety for the industry. To avoid further problems, Samsung said it was introducing an 8-point battery safety check with more intense durability tests; a new test on accelerated usage and a charge and discharge test. The tighter safety measures will be implemented in  every element of the company  devices,  it said, including overall design and materials used. Samsung said it also will seek advice on battery safety and innovation from a group of battery experts. The company has recalled 3.06 million Note 7 phones. About 4 percent, or 120,000 units, of the recalled Galaxy Note 7s have not been returned. --Associated Press

RESTON, Va.-- BUSINESS WIRE --NCI, Inc.  NASDAQ: NCIT   “NCI” or the “Company” , a leading provider of information technology and professional services and solutions to U.S. Federal Government agencies, announced today that, based upon preliminary findings, it has discovered that its controller, acting alone, embezzled money from the Company. The employment of the controller has been terminated, and the Company has commenced an internal investigation with the help of outside counsel and forensic accountants.  While the investigation is ongoing, the Company believes that its former controller embezzled approximately $18 million over the last six years. NCI is working with legal counsel and cooperating with federal authorities to determine the best course of action from a legal, regulatory and recovery perspective, and will provide further information as soon as practicable. NCI believes that after direct recovery from its former controller and after giving effect to available insurance coverage, it will be able to recover a large portion of the embezzled funds.  Of the estimated $18 million of embezzled funds, the Company believes that approximately $5 million was taken during 2016 and the remaining $13 million was taken over the prior five years. The Company’s preliminary findings indicate that these funds were reflected as expenses in the Company’s financial statements. These expenses were treated as allowable indirect costs on its government contracts but should have been classified as unallowable costs. The Company has concluded that the unaudited interim financial statements for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016, contain material errors related to the theft in that period. Therefore, the unaudited financial statements contained in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of 2016 should not be relied upon by investors. As part of the completion of its financial reporting process for the fiscal year 2016, the Company will provide amended financial results for that nine-month period.  The Company has performed a preliminary analysis of the financial effect of the estimated $13 million in theft losses incurred in years before 2016. Based upon preliminary findings, the Company believes that it is unlikely that there are any material misstatements relating to the embezzled funds in the financial statements for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013. At this time, the Company is not aware of any other possible misstatements in the financial statements. If any material errors are discovered through the active investigation and forensic analysis, the Company will make timely disclosure at that time.  In addition, as part of the investigation, the Company is reviewing its internal controls over financial reporting. Although the investigation is ongoing, the Company believes that material weaknesses existed in its internal controls during the relevant periods during which the embezzlement occurred. As a result of these weaknesses, investors, analysts and other persons should not rely on management’s reports on internal controls over financial reporting or the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm’s audit reports on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting filed with the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The Company is implementing steps to strengthen its internal controls and to remediate the weaknesses that it has identified.

International Paper’s Pensacola Mill was originally opened in 1941 by the Florida Pulp and Paper Company; it became part of International Paper in 2000. The mill currently has around 450 employees.  Officials don’t yet know the exact cause of the explosion, the extent of the damage to the mill, or the possible long-term impact on its operations.  The company said they are working with response agencies from the county and state and will have additional information as it becomes available.  Here’s what we do know so far:  International Paper officials have confirmed that all mill employees have been accounted for with no reports of fatalities or injuries at this time.  Escambia County Emergency Communications began receiving calls about the incident at 7:38 p.m. As first responders arrived on scene, they reported a total loss of power at the mill but no active fire.  As of 9 a.m. Monday, personnel from the Escambia County Sherriff’s Office, Florida Highway Patrol, Escambia County Fire Rescue, the State Fire Marshal, Florida Department of Transportation, and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection are on scene. The federal Environmental Protection Agency has also reportedly dispatched personnel to the site.  Escambia County Water Quality and Land Management Staff are testing local waterways for potential environmental impacts.  The Florida Highway Patrol said Monday morning that U.S. Highway 29 remains closed from Muskogee Road south to Tate Road. Muskogee Road remains closed between Jacks Branch Road and Highway 29, and County Road 95A is closed between Woodbury Place and Muskogee Road.  Crews are still working to clear the roads and openings will be announced as they occur, officials said. Motorists are asked to avoid the area if possible.  “The process of roadway cleanup includes placing sand on the roadway and collecting the mixture of sand, pulp and paste, containerizing the material and transporting it to a staging area at International Paper,” said Escambia County spokesperson Joy Tsubooka in a statement. “pH testing is being conducted to ensure cleanup was effective and to ensure that the roadway is safe for drivers.”  “US 29 will remain closed until work crews can wash the roadway,” Florida Highway Patrol officials said in a statement. “The chemical is of a soap type base chemical, and it is unknown what type of reaction the chemical will have when moisture is introduced. The roadway could become slippery, and cause a hazard to the roadway and motorists.”  The Florida Highway Patrol reported two vehicle crashes on Sunday night in the vicinity of the explosion.  FHP is recommending those headed southbound on U.S. 29 detour via County Road 196  Barrineau Park Road , County Road 97  Jacks Branch Road/Muskogee Road/Highway 97 , and West Kingsfield Road. Northbound traffic is recommended to detour via the reverse.  Ash was released during the explosion and has coated some area roadways, vehicles, and other surfaces. Earlier in the evening, Escambia County officials said that the ash “is not hazardous and can be washed off skin with a mild soap and water.”  Other reports — including radio traffic from first responders — said the substance may be “black liquor,” an industrial byproduct which is toxic and corrosive.  International Paper released the following statement just before midnight:  “Ash and pulp material may be present in areas around the mill and roads. If you come in contact with the pulp material  which is a sticky substance , it is advised that you immediately wash your hands with warm or cold water and vinegar. Avoid contact with your eyes and mouth. If your vehicle comes in contact with the pulp material or ash, you are encouraged to wash your vehicle.”  A statement issued Monday by the Florida Highway Patrol confirmed the substance on area roadways is black liquor, noting that it is “a skin, eye and respiratory irritant.”  No residential areas have been evacuated as a result of the explosion.  Escambia County Superintendent of Schools Malcolm Thomas announced last night that all Escambia County schools will be open today.  “We are working with the Escambia County Administrator as they manage the situation following the explosion at International Paper’s mill,” said Thomas. “Our employees who need to travel through the affected area along Highway 29 need to be alert to possible detours or heavy traffic.”  More information will be posted as it becomes available.

The Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  opened a formal investigation into the record-breaking data breach at Yahoo, The Wall Street Journal reports.  The investigation is said to focus on why it took until September 2016 to report a breach that took place in 2014.  The Yahoo breach included the pilfering of information on half-a-billion accounts.  If brought to prosecution, it would mark the first time the SEC has pursued a case based on failure to disclose a data breach.  The FBI, Senate and other groups have also announced plans or begun to investigate Yahoo.  Until the breach was announced, Yahoo was slated to be sold to Verizon. Verizon has since said it still intends to purchase Yahoo but may re-evaluate its price.❤The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating a previously disclosed data breach at Yahoo, the company said in a filing.  Yahoo said in a November 2016 quarterly filing that it was cooperating with federal, state and foreign agencies, including the SEC, that were seeking information and documents about a  security incident and related matters.   The SEC is investigating whether two massive data breaches at Yahoo should have been reported sooner to investors, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.  An SEC spokesman declined to comment. A Yahoo spokesman directed Reuters to the company  November filing.  Yahoo has faced pointed questions about exactly when it knew about a 2014 cyber attack it announced in September that exposed the email credentials of half a billion accounts.  In December, Yahoo said it had uncovered yet another massive cyberattack, saying data from more than 1 billion user accounts was compromised in August 2013.  The SEC issued requests for documents in December, as it probes whether the technology companys disclosures about the cyber attacks complied with civil securities laws, the people said, according to the Journal.  Securities industry rules require companies to disclose cyber breaches to investors. Although the SEC has long-standing guidance on when publicly traded companies should report hacking incidents, companies that have experienced known breaches often omit those details in regulatory filings, according to a 2012 Reuters investigation.  Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner asked the SEC in September to investigate whether Yahoo and its senior executives fulfilled obligations to inform investors and the public about the 2014 hacking attack.  The disclosures from Yahoo about both breaches came after the company agreed to sell its main business to Verizon Communications in July, triggering questions about whether the deal would still be viable and, if so, at what price.  Other agencies looking into the data breach include the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Attorneys Office in Manhattan and a number of State Attorneys General, Yahoo said in the November filing.❤The SEC is investigating whether Yahoo should have publicly disclosed its two mega-hacks earlier than it did — a process that could end up setting important benchmarks for how quickly publicly traded companies have to disclose cybersecurity breaches, the Wall Street Journal reported.  The company disclosed last year that it was cooperating with SEC investigators, but the WSJ report cites “people familiar with the matter” providing the first details about the parameters of the probe.  It wasn’t until September last year, four months after its $4.83 billion sale to Verizon, that Yahoo disclosed a 2014 cyberattack that accessed the email login credentials of half a billion account users. But in a November SEC filing the company disclosed that it had identified state-sponsored hackers in its network back in 2014. Then, in December, Yahoo said it had uncovered yet another massive breach, this one dating from August 2013 and involving more than 1 billion user accounts.  The SEC issued Yahoo requests for documents in December, as part of a probe into whether disclosures about the cyberattacks complied with civil securities laws, the Journal reported. If the agency finds the company should have disclosed one or both of the data breaches sooner, the company could be fined.  Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote the SEC last September, urging just such a probe. “The public ought to know what senior executives at Yahoo knew of the breach, and when they knew it,” he wrote.  In 2011 guidance, the agency explained that existing law requires companies to disclose in public filings cybersecurity incidents determined to have had a “material” effect on the company’s fortunes or prospects. A Reuters investigation the following year found that companies often omitted those details in their filings.  Attorney and data security expert Craig Newman told CyberScoop that the 2011 guidance doesn’t explain how management should handle “the competing demands placed on a company,” regarding disclosure timing, calling it “a fuzzy issue without clear guidance from securities regulators.”  “The issue of when to disclose a data breach creates tension between the need to cooperate with law enforcement in an investigation and the obligation to inform investors and the markets. It’s a dangerous dilemma for companies,” said Newman, head of the Privacy & Data Security practice at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler law firm.  The SEC has previously investigated several large data breaches, including the one at Target, but has not yet taken public action, Newman said: “The Commission has never brought an enforcement action based on a company’s failure to disclose a cyberattack. But it’s been a moving target for years.”  The Journal reported that the agency has been seeking a test case to clarify what it expects from companies in terms of the timeliness of disclosure. But the newspaper also said it was too early to say whether the investigation would result in public action.❤Verizon Communications Inc.  VZ  may have another reason to reconsider its acquisition of Yahoo Inc.’s  YHOO  core Internet assets: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now investigating the timing of when Yahoo disclosed its previously announced data breaches.  According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, investigators at the SEC are looking into the timing of the disclosures and whether or not Yahoo should have alerted investors sooner about the data breaches that may have impacted 1.5 billion user accounts. The SEC requires companies to disclose breaches and cyberattacks as soon as the company determines the attacks could have an impact on its investors.  In December, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it started looking into the 2013 data hack that impacted more than 1 billion user accounts. In November, Yahoo said in an SEC filing that it was cooperating with the hacking investigations, including the SEC’s own investigation. The WSJ, which cited unnamed sources, reported in December that the SEC issued requests for information.  For weeks now, speculation has been swirling about the fate of the Verizon acquisition of Yahoo’s core assets in light of the two massive data breaches. Heading into the week, expectations were high the deal would go through given that Verizon needs to grow outside of the saturated handset market. But the latest development of the SEC inquiry could throw the deal up in the air again. Both Yahoo and Verizon are slated to report earnings this week, and hopes are high there will be some deal clarity.  See also: Verizon Likely to Complete Yahoo Buy Despite Hacks.   The SEC probe into Yahoo’s data breach wasn’t the only bad news for Verizon a day ahead of its quarterly earnings report. The telecom giant’s stock got downgraded by Wells Fargo to market perform from outperform on concerns about “revenue growth headwinds” in 2017 as well as the SEC investigation into Yahoo’s breach.  Wells Fargo thinks Wall Street revenue estimates for 2017 are too high and do not factor in headwinds including more competition from the likes of T-Mobile US Inc.  TMUS  and Sprint Corporation  S , service revenue pressure from moving its customer base to installment plans, a lack of significant scale in its emerging growth business and a perceived need to buy more spectrum.  Well Fargo expects Verizon to have 2017 revenue of $125.5 billion versus the $126.5 billion Wall Street is looking for. “This is NOT a call on its Q4'16 earnings. Rather, we do not think VZ  outperformance since the presidential election is sustainable given growth headwinds in 2017,” Wells Fargo wrote in a note covered by the media.❤The Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  is currently investigating two enormous data breaches at Yahoo and is looking into the matter to determine whether the company should have reported the matter to its investors sooner.  The SEC started conducting its investigations from December 2016 and proceeded with the request for relevant documents, as it looks to determine whether Yahoo complied with the civil security laws on the disclosure of the cyberattacks that took place in 2014.  According to legal notifications, tech companies are required to declare the various risks involved while engaging with such disclosures as these may have a detrimental effect on investors.  The Wall Street Journal says that the investigation surrounding the Yahoo security breach is still in its early stage. Therefore, with regard to any penalties or legal implications involved, one would still have to wait.  The investigation is expected to center on a data breach at Yahoo which took place in 2014. During the security breach, at least 500 million users' personal data was compromised. Yahoo went on to reveal this breach two years later in 2016, even though it had linked the incident to state-sponsored hackers in 2014.  Till date, Yahoo hasn't been able to explain why it took two years to reveal a breach this massive or who took the decision of not going public with this matter. In mid-December 2016, Yahoo revealed that it had recently discovered that more than 1 billion users' private information was exposed during a data breach in August 2013.  Amid all this, Yahoo faced several hurdles on its way to finalizing the acquisition process with Verizon. With the company  recent claims of hackers stealing the data of almost 500 million users in 2014, there were rumors that Verizon was contemplating backing out of the deal or ask for a $1 billion discount.  The situation worsened with the disclosure of the data breach of 1 billion Yahoo users by an  unauthorized third party.   The investigation now not only lays emphasis on what information that was not revealed to investors, but will likely include Verizon, it  to-be parent company. Verizon has also repeatedly stated that it will  evaluate situation as Yahoo continues investigation   The Wall Street Journal states that this could be the first time a federal agency has brought a case against a company for failing to disclose cyber breach.  Yahoo asserts that it is cooperating with  federal, state, and foreign governmental officials and agencies seeking information and/or documents about the Security Incident and related matters, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a number of State Attorneys General, and the U.S. Attorney  office for the Southern District of New York.   © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

As the Wall Street Journal reports, SEC officials formally began requesting documents last December on Yahoo!’s late 2014 data hack. The data hack, which was disclosed last September, affected the personal data of more than 500 million users and Yahoo! linked the breach to a “state-sponsored actor.”  Last December, the search company also disclosed a second data hack that occurred in August 2013. The breach affected an additional 1 billion users and stolen data included email addresses, passwords and security question answers. In a statement with the initial disclosure, Bob Lord, chief information security officer at Yahoo!, said the company has “not been able to identify the intrusion associated with this theft.”  For regulators, the timing of the disclosures for the data hacks will likely play a role in its probe. Last July, Verizon announced it would buy Yahoo!’s core businesses and both data breaches were not disclosed until after the sale. While Verizon has not backed out of the deal, the company is still actively looking into the terms of the agreement and the impact both data hacks would have on the acquisition.  In its November 2016 SEC filing, Yahoo! said it was working with investigators and officials to determine the cause of data hacks.  “The Company is cooperating with federal, state, and foreign governmental officials and agencies seeking information and/or documents about the Security Incident and related matters, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a number of State Attorneys General, and the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York.” Yahoo! said.❤Just like consumers' data histories never fully disappear, the same goes for companies and their data woes.  The Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly investigating whether Yahoo  decision to delay disclosure of its massive data security breaches last year complied with civil securities laws. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the investigation centers on whether the tech company let investors know soon enough after learning of being hacked.  According to the Journal, the investigation is focused on a breach in 2014, when at least 500 million users' profiles were compromised. However, the breach wasn't disclosed until nearly two years later, when in September 2016 the company admitted to being attacked by what some say were state-sponsored hackers. Then in December, Yahoo admitted that another 1 billion accounts were hacked all the way back in 2013.  A Yahoo spokesperson declined to comment on the investigation and referred Adweek to the Form 10-Q filed by the company in November. According to the filing, Yahoo said it is  cooperating with federal, state and foreign governmental officials and agencies seeking information and/or documents about the security incident and related matters.   The report comes on the same day that Yahoo is expected to report its fourth-quarter earnings, potentially the last time it'll do so before Verizon officially closes its acquisition of the company since first announcing it in July. Some people have wondered whether the data breach could affect the sale of the company. However, at Business Insider  Ignition conference in New York last month, Tim Armstrong, CEO of Yahoo  potential future sister company AOL, said he was  cautiously optimistic  everything would go through.

Former Greenwich resident will serve four years for fraud  GREENWICH — A former town resident will serve four years in prison for stealing more than $700,000 from her employer and other parties, U.S. Attorney Deirdre M. Day said Monday.  Debra Biagi, 50, now of Fogelsville, Pa. was sentence in U.S. District Court in New Haven to 48 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release.  Biagi was employed by the HB Nitkin Group of Greenwich, a real estate management and development firm, as an assistant to the company chairman. Her responsibilities included managing the accounts payable for the company, court officials said.  From about February 2014 to December 2015, Biagi defrauded the company, as well as key employees and their family members of a total of $711,071 through various schemes, according to statements made in court.  She pleaded guilty in August to one count of wire fraud and has been ordered to make full restitution, court officials said.  As part of the scheme, Biagi created fake invoices made out to fictitious companies, detailing charges for items such as masonry, carpentry, electrical and plumbing work. She then used victims’ checkbooks to make checks out to the fictitious companies, purportedly to pay the fraudulent invoices, court officials said.  Biagi then deposited the checks into her personal bank account, at times endorsing the check with an illegible signature, and withdrew the monies for her personal use.  At times she simply stole checks from employees of the company and either made the checks out to cash, or endorsed checks that already listed a payee, court officials said in a press release.  Biagi also at times used the signature stamp of the company’s chairman to “sign” the misappropriated checks, making the paid expense to be both legitimate and authorized, the statement from Daly’s office said.❤Federal prosecutors say 50-year-old Debra Biagi, formerly of Greenwich, was also sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to repay all the money.  She pleaded guilty in August to wire fraud for stealing the money from the HB Nitkin Group from February 2014 until December 2015.  She was an assistant to the chairman of the company with responsibilities that included managing accounts payable.  Prosecutors say she created fraudulent invoices made out to fictitious companies for masonry, carpentry, electrical and plumbing work. She then used the victims' checks to the fake companies and deposited the money into her personal bank account.

Chi Wah Soo knew what really happened that night that David Bowie got arrested in Rochester, but it took 40 years for her to finally build up the nerve to tell someone. The 61-year-old owner of Chi Wah Organica in Brighton faced accusations of being the  narc  who led police to Bowie, rocker Iggy Pop and fellow partygoers after a 1976 concert in Rochester. But after a year and half spent earning her trust, filmmaker Matt Ehlers got Soo to reveal the details of the night that has become local rocklore in Rochester, The Democrat  Chronicle reported. Ehlers has been working on a documentary about Bowie  arrest, called  Bowie Goes to Jail,  and Soo  account was a missing piece to the puzzle. David Bowie  famous mugshot from his arrest in Rochester.   Everyone has the wrong idea of what happened,  was all Soo would say to a Rochester reporter at the time.  They can think what they wish, but I know I'm innocent.  Soo was 20 when she and some friends went to see the legendary rocker in Rochester. During the concert, Soo got near the stage where Bowie noticed her and handed her a bracelet that had landed on stage. According to Soo, a man approached her after the concert with a note saying,  Meet me at my party. David.   Hello love,  were the first words Bowie said to her as she walked in the door, Soo recalled. She, Bowie and a group of other people including Iggy Pop, Bowie  bodyguard and two other women then went to Bowie  corner suite at what was then the Americana Rochester on State Street. Soo told Ehlers that the two other women turned out to be undercover police working with investigators in an adjacent hotel room who were listening to the group through the wall. Police were acting on a tip that Bowie had cocaine. Soo explained that Bowie  entourage did not have cocaine, but when they asked one of the undercover officers Deborah Kilborn where they could score some, it was enough for police to raid the room.  That was the start of the nightmare,  said Soo, recalling seeing officers slam the door into Bowie  face as he began to respond to it. It turned out the group did have marijuana, but the charges against Bowie, Soo, Iggy Pop and the body guard were all eventually dropped. Soo said she gave Bowie a traditional Chinese wedding blanket at their arraignment, which she claims shows up in the music video for  China Girl.  She isn't sure if the song is about her, and said she and Bowie never spoke again. Watch more of Soo  interview from the Rochester Democrat  Chronicle.

Ehlers had begun making the documentary Bowie Goes to Jail, about the infamous 1976 arrest of David Bowie in Rochester, and wanted to speak to someone who knew what went down in the corner suite at the Americana Rochester.Chi Wah Soo, the 61-year-old Brighton salon owner, was 20 when arrested and jailed for possession of marijuana with the musician after his concert. At first, people accused her of being the “narc” that blew Bowie into the cops.“Everyone has the wrong idea of what happened,” Soo told a Rochester reporter days after the arrest. “They can think what they wish, but I know I’m innocent.” The Times in London also contacted Soo, but she declined comment per her lawyer’s advice.Silence followed. Almost 40 years. She regularly shrugged off shock jocks pestering her for lurid details on the anniversaries of the arrest.Then came Ehlers, a 46-year-old Rochester filmmaker, who said it took a year and a half of haircuts before Soo trusted him enough to tell her story for the documentary he plans to complete in 2017.Soo’s effervescent personality sparkles in the rough cut Ehlers screened at the Little Theatre last year. Her vivid memories make it feel as though Bowie’s first — and last — Rochester concert happened last night.“She’s a rock star,” said Ehlers, whose short films have appeared at Sundance. “The interview lasted more than two hours.”Chi Wah Soo  Photo: Provided Born in China, Soo moved from Hong Kong to Rochester with her parents and sister when she was 11. As she worked at her father’s restaurant every day after school until 11 p.m., Soo used lyrics from her favorite music to help learn English. After attending Monroe Community College, she was a Kodak employee when Bowie came to town.“I was not going to miss it,” Soo said.She and her friends made sure to get near the stage. Toward the end of the concert, her long black hair tangled among other fans. Perhaps this drew Bowie’s attention, because he leaned over and handed Soo a bracelet that had landed on stage.“I felt bad,” Soo said about the woman who gave the bracelet to Bowie. “But I wasn’t going to give it back.”Before she left the show a man gave her a note saying, “Meet me at my party. David.” When Bowie entered the party, Soo said he seemed to have a “halo around his head.”“Hello, love,” were his first words to her.Later, they retreated to his corner suite at the Americana on State Street  now the Holiday Inn Rochester Downtown  with rocker Iggy Pop and Bowie’s bodyguard. Two other women joined them — undercover police.David Bowie was arrested in Rochester in 1976 for pot possession.

Bowie received a phone call saying his young son was very sick and his wife, Angela, could not be found.“I slowly watched a gentle meltdown of David Bowie,” Soo said.While Bowie made frantic calls, she used a phonebook to identify the original call as a Florida area code. When Soo told Bowie, he instantly realized a couple of girls from Florida were the perpetrators of a cruel prank.Bowie’s entourage had marijuana but they didn’t have cocaine. Undercover police officer Deborah Kilborn said they only asked her where they could score some. Nevertheless, police had enough evidence to raid. Soo saw three faces peer into the room when Bowie cracked open the door. It slammed him in the face and knocked him backward.“That was the start of the nightmare,” said Soo.Matt Ehlers is working on a documentary on the arrest of famed musician David Bowie during a tour through Rochester in 1976.

Ehlers considers the arrest a “wake-up call” in a drug-addled chapter of Bowie’s life.At the arraignment, Soo gave Bowie her traditional Chinese wedding blanket. Although Soo cannot be sure the song China Girl was written about her, she does believe her blanket appears in the music video. Soo and Bowie never spoke again. While his career rocketed back toward Mars, she tried to fade into the background of what has become Rochester “rocklore.”“It has to be one of the best parties in Rochester history,” Ehlers said before laughing about Bowie and Pop doing a shot of Courvoisier right before police escorted them to jail.Almost 41 years later, Ehlers’ quest to tell the full story has brought him to a family business. Like Soo did at her father’s restaurant, her children work at the salon she opened in 1993.“She’s a success story.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and Treasury Department have all inquired into the extent of Flynn’s contact with the Russian government, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal on Sunday. The inquiry is also said to have looked at other Trump advisers, including former campaign manager Paul Manafort and businessman Carter Page. The sources who spoke to the Journal were unclear as to when the inquiry began, what if any incriminating evidence it has produced and whether it was still ongoing. All that they confirmed is that the inquiry was intended to determine whether Flynn’s contact with Russian officials broke the law and that it has focused on telephones call made between Flynn and Sergey Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, on Dec. 29.  Dec. 29 is an important day because that was when then-President Barack Obama announced a series of harsh sanctions against Russia as punishment for their alleged hacking of the 2016 presidential election. Russian dictator Vladimir Putin surprised many foreign policy observers when he opted not to retaliate for the sanctions, with Trump taking to Twitter to praise Putin as “very smart” for his decision. Trump’s press team has since claimed that Flynn merely called Kislyak on the day Obama announced his sanctions to arrange the logistics for a future conversation between Putin and Trump — which is critically important, since it may have otherwise been illegal for him to contact a hostile power in order to undermine existing foreign policy.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has denied that an investigation is occurring, saying that “we have absolutely no knowledge of any investigation or even a basis for such an investigation.” There are a number of ties between Flynn and the Vladimir Putin regime, most notable among them his appearances on the state-subsidized television network Russia Today. Less than a year and a half after exiting as heads of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn gave a talk on international relations for RT that was consistent with Putin’s own agenda, than sat near Putin himself during an RT dinner — a move that raised eyebrows at the time.❤    According to the reporting, the counterintelligence investigation is focused on contacts between Moscow and     NBC News     The report went on to say, “One former intelligence official briefed on the matter said the investigation is looking into whether certain former Trump campaign aides had improper contacts with the Russians.”    It’s against this backdrop that the Wall Street Journal pushed The morning of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, the New York Times published a striking front-page report : multiple U.S. agencies “are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links” between Russian officials and Trump’s close associates.According to the reporting, the counterintelligence investigation is focused on contacts between Moscow and members of Trump’s campaign team , including former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former foreign policy adviser Carter Page, and longtime Republican operative Roger Stone.NBC News added later in the day that the FBI is not only part of a multi-agency investigation into Russia’s alleged intervention in the American presidential campaign, but U.S. officials are also “examining how the operation was paid for and whether any Americans were involved.”The report went on to say, “One former intelligence official briefed on the matter said the investigation is looking into whether certain former Trump campaign aides had improper contacts with the Russians.”It’s against this backdrop that the Wall Street Journal pushed this story forward overnight.  U.S. counterintelligence agents have investigated communications that President Donald Trump’s national security adviser had with Russian officials, according to people familiar with the matter.    Michael Flynn is the first person inside the White House under Mr. Trump whose communications are known to have faced scrutiny as part of investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and Treasury Department to determine the extent of Russian government contacts with people close to Mr. Trump.    It isn’t clear when the counterintelligence inquiry began, whether it produced any incriminating evidence or if it is continuing. Mr. Flynn, a retired general who became national security adviser with Mr. Trump’s inauguration, plays a key role in setting U.S. policy toward Russia.      If the reporting is accurate, it’s a major development. While Manafort, Page, and Stone played key roles in Trump’s campaign operation, none of them has an official role in the White House now. Flynn, however, is also allegedly being investigated – and he has an office in the West Wing. [Update: CNN is reporting that the investigation into Flynn’s talks with Russia is ongoing.]If the reporting is accurate, it’s a major development. While Manafort, Page, and Stone played key roles in Trump’s campaign operation, none of them has an official role in the White House now. Flynn, however, is also allegedly being investigated – and he has an office in the West Wing.  Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Trump’s choice for national security adviser, cultivates close Russian contacts. He has appeared on Russia Today and received a speaking fee from the cable network, which was described in last week’s unclassified intelligence briefing on Russian hacking as “the Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet.”    According to a senior U.S. government official, Flynn phoned Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak several times on Dec. 29, the day the Obama administration announced the expulsion of 35 Russian officials as well as other measures in retaliation for the hacking. What did Flynn say, and did it undercut the U.S. sanctions? The Logan Act  though never enforced  bars U.S. citizens from correspondence intending to influence a foreign government about “disputes” with the United States. Was its spirit violated? The Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.      It appears that the officials overseeing the multi-agency investigation aren’t sure whether that defense is true. Some Democratic senators have     As we        Trump’s team later insisted there was nothing untoward about the communications, and Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Flynn and Kislyak merely spoke to coordinate upcoming conversations between the American and Russian presidents.It appears that the officials overseeing the multi-agency investigation aren’t sure whether that defense is true. Some Democratic senators have already questioned whether Trump’s national security adviser should have his security clearance reexamined, and if Flynn is under investigation, those questions are likely to grow louder.As we discussed last week, Flynn is already butting heads with some top members of Trump’s team, and these latest revelations will only hurt his standing further. If there’s a pool on which member of the White House team is most likely to depart first, keep a close eye on the controversial national security adviser.
AMARILLO, Texas  AP  - Officials say one electrical worker has died and another was critically hurt in a fire at a downtown Amarillo construction site.  An official with University Medical Center in Lubbock says Roger Copelin suffered severe burns and died Sunday. Spokesman Eric Finley says Keath Garrison was in critical condition Monday in the burn unit.  Amarillo Fire Marshal  investigators are trying to determine what started Saturday  blaze that firefighters brought under control within minutes. Deputy Chad Parsons says the complex includes offices being built atop a parking garage.  A statement Monday from the contractor, Opus Design Build, says the company is also investigating the accident that involved workers employed by a subcontractor.  A spokesman for Xcel Energy says the complex will house the utility  new regional headquarters. Xcel is based in Minneapolis.  Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.❤One construction worker has died and one remains hospitalized in critical condition here in Lubbock after an electrical fire in Amarillo on Saturday.  The Amarillo Fire Department says 30-year-old Roper Copelin and another employee, Keath Garrison, were at the new Xcel energy building in downtown working construction when the two drilled into an electrical box.  This started a fire, and they both suffered serious injuries  We're told 30-year-old Roper Copelin died from his injuries early Sunday morning.  The other worker is last said to have burns to more than 50 percent of his body and is on a ventilator in ICU.  A GoFundMe account has been set to help both families during this time.
In the Duarte burn area, many residents decided to stay in their homes home, despite mandatory evacuation orders. Rudy Fuentes, an elementary school teacher, said he stayed behind to protect his home in case things really got out of hand, though he said,  I hope it doesn't come to that.   His driveway was covered in about two inches of mud from Friday  rains and mudflow, and he tied plywood across the driveway to protect it. He  also got sandbags and, on Friday, and he and his son dug a couple of trenches.   We just decided to stick it out,  Fuentes said.  Jerry Katz, a 25-year resident of the neighborhood, wasn't worried at all. He didn't put down sandbags or dig trenches. He blamed nervous lawyers for the city  orders to leave.   The real problem is I can't take my son to Cheesecake Factory tonight,  Katz said.  Orange County officials remained on guard, particularly in Silverado Canyon, which is still recovering from a fire in 2014. Extra emergency crews have been brought in to help, including a bulldozer operator and two additional swift-water rescue teams.  “The ground still remains pretty saturated and … it can be problematic,” said Capt. Alan Wilkes of the Orange County Fire Authority.❤The third in a series of powerful winter storms unleashed a deluge in Southern California on Sunday, flooding numerous roads and freeways, setting new rainfall records and stranding some in dangerously rising waters.  Forecasters had predicted this storm would be the strongest and several years, and it didn't disappoint. While earlier storms produced periods of heavy showers, this one delivered several hours of sustained pounding rain, with damaging results.  Coastal areas of Los Angeles County were among the hardest hit, with Long Beach Airport setting a new all-time rainfall record, 3.87 inches. The intense rain was too much for local roads. Sunday afternoon, both the 110 Freeway in Carson and the 710 Freeway in Long Beach were shutdown due to extreme flooding that left cars stranded like islands in a lake.  In Long Beach and surrounding communities, dozens of intersections were flooded and some residents reported their parked cars were damaged as the rainwater kept rising. Across the region, several people were rescued from their cars and thousands lost power.  Brett Albright, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s office in San Diego, said the storm dumped as much as four inches of rain in some places.  “Today was very intense,” said Albright. “It’s not a normal event. It was definitely a culmination of the perfect circumstances: We had a very intense atmospheric river with a lot of moisture and an area of lift in the atmosphere right over coastal Los Angeles and Orange counties. It forced all of that moisture out.”  “It’s not often we see higher rainfall totals on the coast than in the mountains,” he said.  Southern California has been mired by a 5-year-drought. But this storm is part of a larger shift toward wetter conditions that began last fall. Since October 1, downtown L.A. has received more than 13 inches of rain -- 216% of normal rainfall for this period, which the National Weather Service said was 6.26 inches.  Officials said much of the Southland remains in drought, although recent storms are helping.  On Sunday, the brunt of the storm hit in the afternoon.  Rockslides closed roads in Malibu and other coastal mountain areas. Up the coast in Isla Vista, a cliff and a patio collapsed into the ocean. Rescuers had to evacuate 15 to 20 residents of ocean-front apartment units, according to Gina DePinto, a spokesperson for the County of Santa Barbara.  At least one fatality was believed to be linked to the storm. A motorist in Pomona was driving about 3:15 p.m. amid heavy rains, lost control of the vehicle and smashed into a telephone pole, according to the Pomona Police Department. The driver suffered major injuries and was pronounced dead by Los Angeles County paramedics. The person’s name was not released pending notification of family members.  A homeless encampment off of the Pacific Coast Highway in the Harbor City neighborhood was submerged in several feet of water. Los Angeles fire rescue teams helped three people walk out of the flooded area and brought two others out by boat, officials said.  One of those rescued, a 39-year-old man, was transported to a local hospital. Swift-water rescue teams were still searching the area, a roughly 300-square-foot patch of land with dense vegetation off the highway, for other victims late Sunday afternoon.  Some of the biggest concerns about the storm came from the communities hit by wildfires last year. Heavy rains can cause mudslides in burn areas, and some officials urged residents to evacuate.  Evacuation orders were issued for burn areas in Glendora, Duarte, Silverado Canyon in Orange County and parts of Santa Barbara County.  As of Sunday night, most of the hillsides had held up, to the relief of anxious homeowners.  In the Duarte burn area, many residents chose to stay in their homes. Rudy Fuentes, an elementary school teacher, said he decided to stay behind to protect his home in case things really got out of hand.   I hope it doesn't come to that,  said Fuentes, whose driveway was covered in about two inches of mud.  We just decided to stick it out.   Jerry Katz, a 25-year resident of the neighborhood, wasn't worried at all about the situation. He didn't put down any sandbags or dig any trenches. He blamed the city  orders to leave on nervous lawyers.   The real problem is I can't take my son to Cheesecake Factory tonight,  Katz said.  Orange County officials remained on guard, particularly in Silverado Canyon, which is still recovering from a nearly 1,000-acre fire in 2014. Extra emergency crews have been brought in to help, including a bulldozer operator and two additional swift-water rescue teams.  “The ground still remains pretty saturated and … it can be problematic,” said Capt. Alan Wilkes, of the Orange County Fire Authority.  The epic rains caused something very unusual at Disneyland Sunday -- a quiet day with small crowds. As heavy rains poured and a flash flood warning was issued,  the sparse number of guests hid under the monorail.  Some were clearly unprepared for the rain — wearing jeans, sneakers and hoodies, with some even without umbrellas. “Star Wars” lightsaber umbrellas were selling briskly, despite a hefty price tag of $65.  But the visitors who braved the weather enjoyed short lines — less than half an hour for Hyperspace Mountain, where lines typically can last for 2 hours.  Thunderstorm conditions were expected to ease slightly late Sunday into Monday. But the rainfall is expected to continue until Tuesday.  In all, the storm system is expected to generate 4 to 6 inches of rainfall over the next three days, with the most rainfall in the foothill and mountain areas. Clearer skies and temperatures in the mid to high 60s are expected to return beginning Friday.  The storm also caused problems in Northern California, which has seen a series of major storms over the last few months that lifted much of the region out of drought.  Mudslides and snow closed major roads including Interstate 80. U.S. 395 and Highway 17, the main freeway linking Silicon Valley with Santa Cruz.  Monster surf on Saturday set a new wave height record for the Monterey Bay: 34.12 feet, according to the NWS. The previous record was 32.8 feet, set in 2008. Those conditions smashed the remains of the famed concrete ship, the S.S. Palo Alto, in the Monterey Bay town Aptos.
The third rainstorm to hit Southern California in the past week is dropping inches of rain, flooding roadways and leading to closures.  The 110 was closed for several hours in Carson but is now reopened. The 710 Freeway at Pacific Coast Highway has been shut down in both directions and is under two to three feet of water.  Several roads around the county are closed due to flooding and debris. For an updated list of closures, click here  Five people were rescued from a homeless encampment in Wilmington, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. One man was sent to an area hospital for treatment. No other major injuries were reported.  The storm is putting neighborhoods near recent fire burn areas at risk of mudslides. Residents living in the recent Sand Fire, Colby Fire, Silverado Fire, Sherpa Fire and Fish Fire burn areas are under evacuation orders.  By Sunday evening, much of Los Angeles had received more than an inch of rain, and coastal areas got as much as 2-3 inches. Ventura County got close to two inches. A flood advisory is in effect for Los Angeles County, Ventura County and southeastern Santa Barbara County until Sunday evening. A flash flood warning is in effect for the Palos Verdes Peninsula, Riverside County, San Diego County and Orange County.  Throughout the afternoon, images of flooding from across the region were being shared on social media.   The last time we had a storm of that magnitude was back in late February 2014. [On] February 28, we had over 2 1/2 inches of rain in one day, and in a three-day period we had over 4 inches of rain,  said Joe Sirard, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.  In Duarte, homes where the Fish Fire burned are under mandatory evacuation. An emergency operations center has been set up at the Duarte Community Center  1600 Huntington Drive  and will remain open until mandatory orders are lifted. A mobile shelter for animals will also be on site.   We just have a few people who have decided to take advantage of the evacuation center at this point, but it will be open throughout the entire emergency,  said Karen Herrera, Duarte deputy city manager.  Valley View Elementary School in Duarte will be closed Monday due to the weather, Herrera said.  In Santa Clarita, residents of 120 homes in the vicinity of the recent Sand Fire are under mandatory evacuation. The area under orders is bounded by Placerita Canyon to the south, Sand Canyon to the west and Iron Canyon to the north. An evacuation center is at Canyon High School  19300 Nadal Street . Animals may be taken to the Castaic Animal Shelter  31044 Charlie Canyon Road . Roads are washed out going into the Val Verde community and residents are asked to shelter in place, said Shirley Miller, public information officer with the Santa Clarita Sheriff  Station. As of Sunday afternoon, no residents were at the Canyon High School shelter.  The following areas are closed to all vehicles except public safety and first responders:  In Glendora, about 1,000 homes near where the Colby Fire burned are under a voluntary evacuation advisory. The area is north of Sierra Madre Ave, west to the city boundary with Azusa and the eastern boundary is the west side of the Little Dalton Wash.  In Orange County, homes near the Silverado Canyon burn area are under voluntary evacuation advisory beginning at 9 a.m. Sunday. This affects homes east of 30311 Silverado Canyon Road.  In Ventura County, residents of homes in Camarillo Springs Divisions A, B, C & D are under a voluntary evacuation order. An emergency shelter is open at Leisure Village Recreation Building  1200 Leisure Village Drive .  In Santa Barbara County, an evacuation warning is in effect for Sherpa Fire burn areas. That includes El Capitan Canyon, El Capitan Ranch, El Capitan State Beach, Refugio State Beach, Refugio Canyon, Canada Venadito Canyon, del Coral, and Las Flores Canyon. On Friday, a flood in a creek in El Capitan Canyon swept cabins and vehicles down the narrow canyon.  Los Angeles County is asking the public to watch for unusual flooding or rock falls on roads during the heavy storm this afternoon, and report anything unusual to the dispatch: 1-800-675-4357.  There  a winter storm warning in effect for local mountains. High elevations above 6,000 feet could get up to 18 inches of snow, and lower elevations could get anywhere from a dusting to 6 inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service. Even the Grapevine could get about an inch of snow for Monday morning, which could make the drive difficult.  This story has been updated.❤ AP Photo/Richard Vogel .

LOS ANGELES  AP  - The third and most powerful in a series of storms pounded Southern California on Sunday, dropping nearly 4 inches of rain south of Los Angeles, flooding freeways and raising concerns about damaging mudslides.  Commuters could expect a messy drive to work Monday in several areas, with rainfall expected to ease slightly but not taper off until Tuesday.  Flash flood watches and warnings were in effect for swaths of greater Los Angeles and across Southern California where multiple roads were closed Sunday or blocked by fallen trees.  The National Weather Service cautioned that the system was expected to gain strength into Sunday evening and could end up being the strongest storm in at least seven years. California has been swamped during a wet winter that has brought plenty of rain and snow after years of drought.  By early evening, the rainfall had set new records. Long Beach Airport received 3.87 inches of rain by 5 p.m., breaking the all-time daily record for rainfall. Los Angeles Airport got 2.78 inches of rain Sunday, another all-time daily record.  Firefighters in San Bernardino County staged a dramatic swift-water rescue of a couple whose pickup truck was trapped in surging water west of the Cajon Pass. Television footage showed rescue crews sending a raft, which was anchored to a fire truck, into rushing brown water so the trapped couple could climb aboard, one by one, from the car  passenger window.  Fast-moving floodwaters swept through California mountain communities and residents fled homes below hillsides scarred by wildfires. Forecasts said mountain locations could see up to 6 inches of rain. Rain fell at a rate of nearly three-quarters of an inch per hour.  Residents in rural Santa Cruz County watched helplessly Sunday as the San Lorenzo River spilled over its banks for the second time this month, sending muddy water and debris into yards and homes. No injuries were reported.   This is the fastest I've ever seen this river move. It  already flowing under my house. I have maybe 2 feet of clearance before it  in my living room,  Paradise Park resident Tammy Grove told the Sentinel newspaper.  Battalion Chief Aldo Gonzales with the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the river is the highest he has ever seen it.  Traffic was diverted off Interstate 110 south of downtown Los Angeles because of water flowing across lanes. The 710 Freeway was also closed because of flooding.  Authorities ordered evacuations near wildfire burn areas in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Orange counties. Potential debris flows could restrict access for emergency responders, officials said.  Some residents refused to leave, but Ralph Olivas loaded up his family and their dog and left his home in Duarte, nestled in scenic foothills east of Los Angeles that were left bare by wildfires last June. Recent rain sent rocks down steep streets where homeowners built protective barriers out of lumber and sandbags.   We're packing and leaving because the muds are coming, the mudslides,  he told Los Angeles news station KCAL-TV, adding that the risk  comes with the territory living up here.   Farther north, officials warned of a  high avalanche danger  at all elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains because of heavy snowfall that has closed several ski resorts. The Sierra Avalanche Center advised Sunday against travel in the area, warning of intense snowfall rates and gale force winds.  The San Francisco Bay Area was under a high surf advisory along the coast until early Tuesday with waves of up to 19 feet expected, National Weather Service meteorologist Steve Anderson said.   Surf will be coming up and down, but coming so fast there  no break,  he said.  The San Francisco Coast Guard warned of hazardous conditions at beaches after two people went missing in the water near Pebble Beach on Saturday.  Along the coast, big surf rolled ashore, with record 34-foot swells recorded Saturday in Monterey Bay. .  A historic WWI-era ship called the S.S. Palo Alto and docked near Santa Cruz was torn apart by massive waves Saturday.  The Bay Area was also under a flash flood watch that continues through Monday and a wind advisory was in effect until late Sunday.  Wine country communities that already experienced destructive flooding this month faced new flood warnings after strong thunderstorms Sunday.   We're seeing mudslides Bay Area wide,  said Anderson, adding that heavy rain over the past few weeks has saturated the ground. Wind gusts topping 50 mph brought down trees across Northern California.  In Mendocino County, a massive oak toppled onto an apartment in the city of Ukiah early Saturday, crushing the building and killing a woman as she lay in her bed, fire officials told the Press Democrat newspaper of Santa Rosa. The woman  boyfriend and a 3-year-old boy escaped.  Capt. Pete Bushby of the Ukiah Valley Fire Authority said heavy rain apparently had destabilized the 125-foot tree.

Long Beach Airport saw an all-time daily record rainfall of 3.87 inches, while Los Angeles Airport and Camarillo also saw record rainfall — 2.78 inches and 2.61 inches, respectively, according to the National Weather Service. Since Oct. 1, 2016, downtown Los Angeles has received 13.52 inches of rain — 216 percent of the usual rainfall in that period, the agency said.  In Monterey Bay, a new wave height record was also set at 34.12 feet, according to NWS. The previous record had been 32.8 feet, set in 2008.  The severe conditions flooded roads and freeways across the region, forcing them to shut down, and evacuations were ordered for homes in recent burn areas, including near the Sand Fire in Santa Clarita and Fish Fire in Duarte. Recent burn areas in Santa Barbara County and Silverado Canyon in Orange County were also affected.  Topanga Canyon Boulevard near Old Topanga Canyon Road was expected to be closed two to three days due to a mudslide, Caltrans District 7 tweeted. Solstice Canyon and Paramount Ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains were also closed due to heavy rains, officials said.  Flash flood warnings had been issued through 4:30 p.m. for various areas — including the South Bay, L.A. Harbor, Long Beach, Anaheim, Santa Ana and Ventura County. The advisory extended through the night for Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.  The Los Angeles Fire Department executed water rescues for 12 people and two pets while responding to a total of 172 incidents related to the storm including flooding, debris flows, fallen trees and transformer fires, according to a statement from the city of L.A.  One emergency shelter was open at the Wilmington Greenbelt Community Center, 918 North Sanford Ave., to provide assistance to the dozens of residents displaced from their homes due to flooding.  Long Beach resident Jerry Melena said despite the damaged caused by the storm he was thankful it would ease California’s longstanding drought.  “We absolutely needed this water and it’s good to see that rain is actually doing what it’s supposed to do,” he told KTLA while overlooking the L.A. River. “That’s what these canals were made for, for water to go through, and we hadn’t seen water in years.”  Wind gusts throughout the region reached as high as 83 mph in Camp Nine in the San Gabriel Mountains, NWS said, and the strong gusts knocked down trees and power lines across Southern California. A high wind warning remains in effect until 7 p.m. Sunday in the mountains of Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties.  As of 9 p.m., power was knocked out for a total of 13,410 Southern California Edison customers in Los Angeles and Orange counties — 6,146 in Los Angeles and 7,264 in Orange, the company said. Power was expected to be restored in most areas by early morning Sunday.  Laurel Canyon Boulevard was closed in Hollywood Hills at Kirkwood Drive due to a downed tree, fire officials said. L.A. city officials had responded to at least 54 downed trees, according to a statement.  Los Angeles County health officials have also issued a beach use advisory through at least Wednesday due to rain runoff concern.❤ Watchara Phomicinda/Los Angeles Daily News via AP .

LOS ANGELES  AP  - The Latest on winter storms in California  all times local :  The National Weather Service has expanded flash-flood warnings across Southern California as a storm dumps rain at a rate of nearly three-quarters of an inch per hour.  Traffic has been diverted off Interstate 110 south of downtown Los Angeles Sunday because of flooding in lanes.  Evacuations are ordered near wildfire burn areas in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Orange counties. Officials say potential debris flows could restrict access for emergency responders.  The weather service says excessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as other drainage areas and low lying spots.  A flash-flood watch and wind advisory is also in effect across the San Francisco Bay Area, where thunderstorms are expected into the evening.  A historic ship from the World War I era was torn apart by massive waves that have slammed the California coast during this weekend  storm.  The East Bay Times reports  http://bayareane.ws/2jNWmuH  that strong waves on Saturday broke the S.S. Palo Alto  stern from the rest of the boat.  The ship, also known as  The Cement Boat,  is docked at a pier in Seacliff State Beach, south of Santa Cruz.  National Weather Service meteorologist Steve Anderson said that swells in Monterey Bay reached about 34 feet on Saturday, setting a record over the previous swell height of 32 feet in 2008.  On Sunday there was a high surf advisory in effect through early Tuesday, with waves forecast at 15 to 19 feet.  The S.S. Palo Alto was built in 1919 as an oil tanker by the San Francisco Shipbuilding Company, but it never went into wartime service. It was later bought by the Seacliff Amusement Corporation and towed to Seacliff State Beach, where it was refitted as an amusement ship with a casino and dance hall. It has been closed for decades and left in place as an artificial reef for marine life and a highly photographed landmark.  The Sierra Avalanche Center has warned there is a  high avalanche danger  at all elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains because of heavy snowfall that has closed several ski resorts.  The center advised Sunday against travel in the area, warning of intense snowfall rates and gale-force winds.  National Weather Service meteorologist Steve Anderson said that up to 4 feet of snow were forecast above 4,000 feet, which includes the Lake Tahoe area. And more snow was expected at higher elevations.  The Alpine Meadows ski resort was closed Sunday, according to its website. The Squaw Valley resort opened limited trails, saying it had picked up 16 inches of snow in the past 24 hours.  Fast-moving floodwaters swept through mountain communities south of the San Francisco Bay Area as thunderstorms and powerful winds wallop California.  Residents of Paradise Park watched helplessly Sunday as the San Lorenzo River spilled over its banks for the second time this month, sending muddy water and debris into yards and some homes. No injuries have been reported.  Battalion Chief Aldo Gonzales for the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection tells the Sentinel newspaper that the river is the highest he  ever seen it.  Rock slides, debris flows and flooding have closed roads and snarled traffic up and down the state as the third storm in four days dumped heavy rain and snow in the mountains.  Flash flood watches and warnings are in effect for swaths of greater Los Angeles, where mountain locations could see up to 6 inches of rain.  California residents have evacuated neighborhoods below hillsides scarred by wildfires as the third - and largest - in the latest series of storms brings powerful rain and warnings about flash flooding and possible mudslides.  The National Weather Service says the system is gaining strength Sunday and could be the strongest in at least seven years. Flash flood watches and warnings are in effect for swaths of greater Los Angeles, where mountain areas could see more than 2 inches of rain.  Evacuations are ordered near wildfire burn areas in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Orange counties. Officials say potential debris flows could restrict access for emergency responders.  To the north, a band of strong thunderstorms is moving through the San Francisco Bay Area and heavy snow is expected in the Sierra Nevada.  Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Ray Gallison, the Bristol Democrat who formerly chaired the powerful House Finance Committee, has agreed to plead guilty to nine federal charges of mail fraud, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and filing false tax returns, investigators announced Monday.  US Attorney Peter Neronha said the common thread is how Gallison was taking money -- a total of about $660,000 -- from other people, for his own benefit.   Mr. Gallison was essentially, as alleged, stealing from wherever he could,  Neronha said.  Didn’t matter if the person was deceased, it didn’t matter if it was public money that he needed to shift around to meet his purposes, it didn’t matter if it was someone who was disabled and he was the sole trustee.   Gallison, a 16-year lawmaker, abruptly resigned last May in the face of a wide-ranging law enforcement investigation.  Prosecutors say that according to signed court documents,  Gallison will admit to wide-ranging fraudulent and deceptive conduct to steal private money and hide his misuse of public money, and covering his tracks while doing so. Gallison will admit to the theft of funds from the estate of a deceased individual to which he was appointed executor; theft of funds from a Special Needs Trust established to protect the long-term welfare of a disabled individual to which he was appointed trustee; providing false information on tax documents, including vastly inflating the number of students assisted by a non-profit organization funded by public money while failing to disclose amounts paid by that organization to him; and failure to pay taxes on income derived from his criminal actions.   Gallison could face a sentence of more than two years in prison. The sentence could be much longer, and Gallison could also face significant fines, according to the plea agreement he signed.  Gallison rose to the role of House Finance chairman after Nicholas Mattiello became speaker in 2014.  Last year, the FBI seized about $810,000 in assets under Gallison  control, some of which belonged to the estate of a friend, Ray Medley, who died in 2012. Medley had hired Gallison to handle the liquidation of his estate. Prosecutors say Gallison will admit that he fraudulently used Medley  name and Social Security number to execute part of the estate.  Another part of the case involves the filing of a false tax document for Alternative Education Programming, a nonprofit group that received legislative grants during the course of Gallison  involvement with the group. He was previously listed as AEP  assistant director.  Prosecutors say the false tax document listed almost $78,000 in tuition and related expenses for 47 students, from July 2012 to June 2013. In fact, authorities say, Gallision paid only $3,137 to assist two students during that year. They also say Gallison defrauded a disabled person  special needs trust by writing an $8,900 check that he deposited into the AEP account.  Also involved in the investigation were the FBI, the attorney general  office, State Police, and the IRS.  During a news conference detailing the charges, Neronha and Attorney General Peter Kilmartin expressed frustration about the persistence of wrongdoing by elected officials in Rhode Island.  One former rep, John Carnevale, pleaded not guilty earlier this month to charges of perjury and filing false documents. Another, Peter Palumbo, pleaded not guilty earlier this month to charges of embezzlement and filing a false document. Both men are Democrats.  Neronha said it was wrong for some in Rhode Island to downplay crimes by public officials that don't directly involve government activity. Former House speaker Gordon Fox - now in prison for corruption -- made that argument when a string of reps got arrested during his tenure as speaker.  Asked if the Gallison case is a matter of public corruption, Neronha said,  To me, whenever a public official raises his right hand, or her right hand, and takes an oath to serve the people, that means they should be of good character in their public and private life. I don't draw that distinction. I think it  a false choice that we have to make when we make that distinction. There are those of us in public office who don't have a personal capacity -- we're always acting in our official capacity. And frankly, it shouldn't be that difficult to act with character in all walks of your life, public and private.    It is at least ironic -- at least ironic -- that someone who engages in this level of financial fraud is the House finance chair,  Neronha continued.  I mean, if that isn't setting up alarm bells to folks, it ought to.   The US attorney expressed frustration that prosecuting cases involving public officials takes time away from efforts to raise awareness about the dangers of opioids and other pressing issues.  Like Neronha, Attorney General Peter Kilmartin vowed that prosecutors will remain vigilant in looking at cases of public wrongdoing. Kilmartin, a 20-year former state rep, also said the vast majority of public officials are decent and honest.   Ray Gallison was greedy, pure and simple,  Kilmartin said.  He stole from his clients, people who considered him a trusted attorney and a trusted friend. That greed caught up with him.   Kilmartin said repeated prosecutions of public officials should help reduce public cynicism about Rhode Island politics.   Don't let the likes of Ray Gallison and Gordon Fox and others tarnish your opinion of public service, or the many honorable men and women who choose to enter it,  Kilmartin added.  Neronha said that of about $660,000 in theft by Gallison, $515,000 was in the form of stock certificates that have been recovered and will be returned to the appropriate estate. He said Gallison has agreed to pay $100,000 at or before sentencing, and that prosecutors will go after the remaining $60,000.  Asked if sees a need for other steps to deter wrongdoing by public officials, Neronha said in part,  It  really on all of us -- the public, law enforcement, frankly, fellow public officials -- to make it clear that that kind of conduct, the kind of conduct we've talked about far too often, is conduct that folks view with approbation.   John Marion, executive director of the good government group Common Cause of Rhode Island, said his organization has sent a letter to the state Ethics Commission, requesting an audit of the financial disclosure statements of all state lawmakers. Common Cause is also requesting the state Board of Elections to perform an audit for the campaign accounts of state legislators.   Rhode Island can no longer afford to wait for law enforcement to step in and clean up the mess after the public trust has been betrayed,” Marion said. “The people of Rhode Island deserve to know that legislators are obeying the law before it rises to a criminal offense and people suffer.”  Speaker Mattiello reacted to the charges with this statement: “I commend U.S. Attorney Neronha and Attorney General Kilmartin for their diligent work in identifying, investigating and rooting out illegal behavior.  Elected officials must be held to the highest standard.  When they cross the line, they should be investigated and prosecuted.”  As far as Marion  request for audits, a spokesman said,  Speaker Mattiello believes the Ethics Commission should do whatever it deems to be appropriate.   In a statement, Governor Gina Raimondo said, “Rhode Islanders deserve to have faith in their government and trust that their elected leaders will never use their public position to enrich themselves. Today’s disappointing news puts that faith at risk and requires all of us in public service to reaffirm our commitment to the public trust. No one should enter public service in pursuit of personal gain.”  This report has been updated.❤Tom Mooney Journal Staff Writer   Mooneyprojo 			 			PROVIDENCE -- Federal authorities filed criminal charges against Raymond E. Gallison Jr., Monday alleging the former House Finance Committee chairman robbed a dead man’s estate, a disabled person’s trust fund and from disadvantaged youth seeking help from the educational non-profit he worked for.   His take, prosecutors say, more than $660,000. The charges – wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and filing false tax returns – could send Gallison, 64, of Bristol, to federal prison for at least two years and possibly twice that long as part of a guilty plea agreement also announced Monday morning by U.S. Attorney Peter Neronha. “At bottom he lied and he stole, in a variety of ways and from a variety of people,” said Neronha. “Mr. Gallison was essentially stealing wherever he could. It [didn’t] matter if the person was deceased…or the person was disabled.” Authorities say the charges that Gallison has admitted to essentially stem from three individual schemes: That while working for the taxpayer-supported educational nonprofit called Alternative Education Programming  AEP , Gallison stole more than $64,575 earmarked to help disadvantaged youth attend the Community College of Rhode Island. That he took $8,900 from a trust account of a disabled person to cover his theft from AEP.  Gallison had been appointed trustee to assure the long-term welfare of the disabled person.  And that he devised various plots to steal $677,957 in stock from the estate of a supposed friend who had entrusted Gallison to serve as his will’s executor. The charges were the result of an at least 10-month investigation which law enforcement officials initially said began with allegations that Gallison arranged meetings for a prostitute during his 16-year tenure as a lawmaker. Officials say their investigation did not substantiate those prostitution allegations. Gallison’s world imploded last March when state and federal investigators searched his home at 50 King Philip Ave., in Bristol. That same month Neronha subpoenaed Barrington officials to produce the probate court file of the late Ray Medley to a federal grand jury for review. Medley, a life-long bachelor, had named his “good friend  Gallison to be the executor of his will, and also identified nine charities and non-profits as beneficiaries to his estate. Medley died at 65 in February 2012. Years passed without any of those beneficiaries receiving money as expected. In early 2016, a representative of the Massasoit Historical Association, where Medley served as president for many years, shared her concerns with Thomas E. Wright, a former assistant U.S. Attorney and friend of Medley’s. Wright told the Journal last summer that he immediately became suspicious that “something is wrong here” when he looked at the will’s inventory. Missing were hundreds of thousands of dollars in stocks and bonds that he knew Medley had. Meanwhile on another front, state and federal investigators were looking at Gallison’s running of the Providence-based AEP educational nonprofit. Records show the college preparedness organization had received more than $2.2 million in state grants between 2003 and last year. Gallison served on the House Finance Committee that approved many of those taxpayer-supported expenditures. In 2014 he rose to chair the committee – seven years after paying a $6,000 fine to the state Ethics Commission for not disclosing for three consecutive years the money he eared as an AEP employee. Prosecutors alleged that while he served as AEP’s assistant director, Gallison vastly inflated the numbers of students the agency was helping to skim money out of the budget for himself. Gallison headed AEP after its founder died in 2014. In 2015, AEP filed documents with the IRS that listed one woman, Aubrey Lombardo, as president, though the Providence lawyer told the Journal last May she never held that position and never signed the document that carried her signature. And other documents filed with the state Secretary of State’s office named yet another woman, Mary Ellen Raposa, as its president. During their investigation, agents and detectives searched Gallison’s State House office. Gallison visited State Police headquarters in Scituate and some lawmakers said they heard rumors he was wearing a wire. He wasn’t. But on May 3, days after meeting with House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and his chief of staff at a Newport Creamery in Cranston, Gallison resigned his seat after 16 years on Smith Hill. Three days later the FBI seized $992,879 in assets in Gallison’s control, much of it stock shares connected to Medley’s estate. Gallison is the third former state representative in as many weeks to face criminal charges. The state police last week charged former state Rep. Peter Palumbo with violating campaign finance laws by embezzling from his campaign coffers and filing a false document. Days earlier former Rep. John Carnevale – who was also the vice chairman of the House Finance Committee -- pleaded not guilty to three felony counts of perjury before the Providence Board of Canvassers regarding where he actually lived, and one count of filing a false document. Monday’s announcement regarding Gallison resembled a similar news conference Neronha held in 2015 announcing criminal charges against former House Speaker Gordon Fox. Fox also pleaded guilty and is now serving three years in federal prison for bribery, fraud and filing false tax returns. Neronha voiced frustration with the repeated episodes of politicians violating their public oath to honorably serve.  It shouldn't be that difficult to uphold that oath well.  Everybody up here,  he said, gesturing to the law enforcement officials surrounding him,  and many people beyond, do it every single day. It’s not that difficult. It really isn't, in my view.   When you've stood here for seven and a half years and you're back here for the same thing over and over again, it’s a little frustrating, particularly when you have a lot of other things you could be doing.   This says something about our political culture here which I think should get out attention.  State Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin, who served in the General Assembly for 20 years, said, “I would like to tell the public that despite these high profile prosecutions…there are many good people who serve in our government.” But while Kilmartin stressed these were individual cases, Neronha ended the news conference saying: “This says something about a political culture here.”   Correction: An earlier version of this report had the wrong total amount of money involved.  -- This report was updated at 11:34  277-7359 On Twitter: @mooneyprojo❤Former state Rep. Ray Gallison agreed to plead guilty to nine criminal charges Monday including fraud, tax fraud, and identity theft, according to an announcement from U.S. Attorney Peter Neronha and Attorney General Peter Kilmartin.  “At bottom, he lied and he stole, in a variety of ways and from a variety of people,” Neronha said.  “Ray Gallison was greedy – pure and simple,” Kilmartin said. “He stole from his clients, people who considered him a trusted attorney and a trusted friend. That greed caught up with him.”  According to a press release from the US Attorney’s Office, “Gallison will admit to wide-ranging fraudulent and deceptive conduct to steal private money and hide his misuse of public money, and covering his tracks while doing so. Gallison will admit to the theft of funds from the estate of a deceased individual to which he was appointed executor; theft of funds from a Special Needs Trust established to protect the long-term welfare of a disabled individual to which he was appointed trustee; providing false information on tax documents, including vastly inflating the number of students assisted by a non-profit organization funded by public money while failing to disclose amounts paid by that organization to him; and failure to pay taxes on income derived from his criminal actions.”  Gillison will be charged with four counts of mail fraud; one count of wire fraud; one count of aggravated identity theft; one count of aiding the filing of a false tax document; and two counts of filing a false tax return. According to a Plea Agreement filed in this matter, Gallison will serve, at a minimum, two years in federal prison.  “Rhode Islanders deserve to have faith in their government and trust that their elected leaders will never use their public position to enrich themselves,” said Governor Gina Raimondo. “Today’s disappointing news puts that faith at risk and requires all of us in public service to reaffirm our commitment to the public trust. No one should enter public service in pursuit of personal gain.”  “I commend U.S. Attorney Neronha and Attorney General Kilmartin for their diligent work in identifying, investigating and rooting out illegal behavior,” said Speaker Nicholas Mattiello.  “Elected officials must be held to the highest standard.  When they cross the line, they should be investigated and prosecuted.”  As executor of an estate of an individual from Barrington, R.I., who passed away in February 2012, Gallison devised and executed various schemes to steal or transfer to his own name and bank accounts, cash, checks, stocks and real property belonging to the deceased person and/or his estate, valued at a total of $677,957.06. Gallison will admit that he fraudulently used the name and social security number of the deceased person to execute a scheme to cause the liquidation of certain stocks belonging to the deceased person.  He caused the filing of a false tax document on behalf of Alternative Education Programming  AEP , a non-profit organization which provided educational programs to students who may need assistance with course work, and/or minority and/or disadvantaged students who may need financial or other assistance to gain an education, and of which Gallison was listed as Assistant Director. The tax document listed that $77,957 in tuition and related fees and expenses were paid for 47 students from July 1, 2012, through June 30, 2013. In fact, on behalf of AEP, Gallison paid only $3,137.29 to assist 2 students during that year and paid approximately $64,575 to himself and another person in wages and consulting fees for no work undertaken on AEP’s behalf;  As trustee for a disabled person’s Special Needs Trust, he defrauded the Trust by writing a check from the Trust account for $8,900, which he deposited into an AEP account. Gallison then wrote a check for $8,800 from the AEP account to pay an outstanding bill at the Community College of Rhode Island;  He failed to claim a total of $622,286.17 in income on joint IRS tax returns for tax years 2012 and 2013, and, as a result of his relevant conduct from 2012-2015, Gallison failed to pay a total of $226,332.31 in taxes.  Gallison was chairman of the powerful House finance committee. He resigned in May amid state and federal investigations.  Earlier this month, two other Democratic former House members were criminally charged in state court for unrelated conduct.
A fire breaks out in Bates Collison on Buffalo Road in Wesleyville around 1:15 Sunday afternoon - quickly filling the air with heavy smoke.  Nia Zimmer, who witnessed the fire, says,  I was at Country Fair getting gas. Saw a little bit of smoke. Next thing I know there  a lot of smoke.

The spill was reported around 7:30 a.m. on Ginny Lane near Sunset Boulevard, according to Cpl. Cameron Mortenson of the Lexington Police Department. A person walking out of Starbucks smelled an odor, and police found a work truck nearby that was carrying two chemicals. “There was some sort of connection between the two chemicals,” Mortenson said, adding that when the two chemicals came together, it caused a gas odor and some smoke. The Lexington County Fire Service was trying to determine what chemicals were involved and how they came into contact. Five nearby businesses were evacuated while crews worked the scene, but those evacuations have been lifted.

EUGENE, Ore. — Oregon co-offensive coordinator David Reaves, who joined the Ducks with Willie Taggart from USF, will be fired after his arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence, the school said Sunday, marking the latest problem for the Pac-12 team under new coach Taggart.  Reaves, 38, was placed on administrative leave and the process to fire him had started, the school said. Oregon announced his hiring Tuesday.  The move came less than a week after the school suspended football strength and conditioning coach Irele Oderinde, who also joined the Ducks from USF with Taggart, for a month without pay after an intense workout sent three players to the hospital.  Reaves who was stopped at 2:12 a.m. Pacific time Sunday with a passenger in Eugene after  multiple traffic violations,  police said. The responding officer suspected Reaves was impaired, and after an investigation, Reaves was charged and booked at Lane County jail at 5:18 a.m., police said.  Reaves left after posting bail at 9:52 a.m., jail records said. He must appear Wednesday in Eugene Municipal Court.  The passenger was not identified. No recruits or current players were in the car with Reaves, senior associate athletic director Craig Pintens told the Portland Oregonian.  Reaves was on a two-year contract worth $300,000 annually and was to share offensive coordinator duties with offensive line coach Mario Cristobal as well as coach tight ends and have the title of passing game coordinator.  At USF, where he joined Taggart in 2013, Reaves called the plays during the Bulls' Dec. 29 Birmingham Bowl victory over South Carolina.  Reaves is a Tampa native. His father, John, was a star quarterback at Robinson High and then Florida, and was a first-round draft pick  14th overall  by the Philadelphia Eagles in 1972.  David Reaves was a standout quarterback at Spring Valley High in Columbia, S.C., graduating in 1997, and then was a three-year starting quarterback at Appalachian State. He was an assistant coach at Tampa Catholic in 2001 before getting his first college job at South Carolina the next year.  Reaves was with the Gamecocks through 2008, the final four years under Steve Spurrier, before he joined then-brother-in-law Lane Kiffin at Tennessee in 2009.  At Tennessee, Reaves was one of several Volunteers staff members to draw NCAA scrutiny. In 2010, ESPN reported that the NCAA had questioned Reaves about the use of Tennessee  hostess program in recruiting. In 2011, when Reaves was the quarterbacks coach and passing game coordinator at New Mexico, the NCAA accused him of requesting that others make impermissible contact by telephone with recruits. One year later, the NCAA  Committee on Infractions ruled that Kiffin  Tennessee staff committed a dozen secondary violations but no major infractions.❤Eugene, Ore. • The University of Oregon says the football co-offensive coordinator will be fired after his arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence, marking the latest problem for the team.

MONTGOMERY — Gov. Robert Bentley this morning said he was aware of “some” state investigations into his office, but repeated that neither he nor his staff has done anything wrong.He also said someone broke the law in talking to the media about an investigation by the Alabama Ethics Commission.“Someone is leaking that and that’s illegal,” Bentley told reporters in Montgomery. He met with reporters after speaking briefly at a summit of Alabama sheriffs.Today, the website Alabama Political Reporter published a story that said the investigative arm of the State Ethics Commission is nearing completion of its probe into potential ethics violations by Bentley and his former adviser Rebekah Caldwell Mason.The story said “well-placed sources” say Bentley and Mason recently received letters requiring their appearance before special agents of the commission.“Now, we need to look into this, we need to investigate this,” Bentley said this morning. “This is something that should never happen. There are grand jury secrecy laws that cover this. I’m not going to comment on it because I’m not going to break the law, but somebody already has done that and we need to look into that.“There’s been a lot of rumors and innuendos and political foolishness that has been going on in the last year. I want to say this: Nobody in my office past or present has ever done anything illegal or unethical, I have never done anything illegal or unethical, and I am eager to say that. I just have not had the opportunity to do that.”Rep. Johnny Mack Morrow, D-Red Bay, filed ethics complaints against Mason last year alleging she influenced the governor to twice kill legislation Morrow sponsored in 2013 and that she and her husband, Jon Mason, filed false information on their statement of economic interest reports.Morrow today said he hasn’t heard anything about the status of his complaints, but he wouldn’t expect to be updated about any possible investigation.State Auditor Jim Zeigler also filed an ethics complaint against the governor last year. He declined comment today, saying he was hamstrung by a gag order.Ethics Commission Director Tom Albritton was not immediately available for comment.In April, 23 House members signed impeachment articles after Bentley  fired law enforcement secretary, Spencer Collier, accused the governor in March of having an affair with Mason and of interfering in law enforcement business.The committee announced Nov. 3 that it was suspending proceedings at the request of Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange. Strange asked for the suspension while his office was pursuing  related work. Bentley, who is now divorced, admitted to inappropriate behavior and apologized to his family. But the governor denied a sexual affair and the other allegations.Bentley recently said he has never been told of an AG investigation and as far as he’s concerned, there isn’t one.❤Gov. Robert Bentley Monday suggested he may pursue an investigation following a published report that an ethics investigation into his relationship with a former political adviser was nearing an end.Governor Robert Bentley speaks to the media at the annual Alabama Sheriff  conference in Montgomery, Ala., on Monday, Jan. 23, 2017.   Photo: Albert Cesare Alabama Political Reporter said Monday that the Alabama Ethics Commission was wrapping up a probe into Bentley and former senior political adviser Rebekah Caldwell Mason. Two state officials filed complaints last year over allegations about their personal and professional relationship.Tom Albritton, director of the Alabama Ethics Commission, declined comment Monday morning, citing the grand jury nature of such proceedings. Bentley, who says he has done nothing wrong, declined comment on the report but questioned why the status of the investigation became public.“We need to look into this,” the governor said. “We need to investigate this. This is something that should never have happened.”Former Alabama Law Enforcement Agency Secretary Spencer Collier in March accused Bentley – who was divorced from his wife Dianne in 2015 after 50 years of marriage – of pursuing an affair with Mason while he was married; of using state resources to do so and of attempting to stop Collier cooperating with a criminal investigation of former House Speaker Mike Hubbard, R-Auburn.Audio of Bentley making suggestive comments on a phone call later surfaced. The governor acknowledged making inappropriate remarks to Mason, but both she and Bentley deny having a “physical affair.” Collier’s allegations led State Auditor Jim Zeigler and Rep. Johnny Mack Morrow, D-Red Bay, to file ethics complaints against the governor.Zeigler’s complaint – a report on what had been alleged – incorporated Collier’s accusations, and also raised questions about Mason receiving money from the Alabama Council for Excellent Government  ACEGOV , set up in 2015 by former Bentley aides to promote the governor’s agenda. Mason said she received $15,000 from ACEGOV in 2015. Zeigler said in his complaint that Mason should have registered as a lobbyist.Morrow alleged that Mason used her influence with the governor to kill two local bills for his northwest Alabama district.Gov. Robert Bentley and former political advisor Rebekah Caldwell Mason.  Photo: Dave Martin/AP Zeigler said in an email Monday he was  hamstrung by a gag directive.  Morrow said in a phone interview Monday he had not received any updates from the Ethics Commission about his complaint.The allegations also led to a House investigation into the possibility of impeaching Bentley. The House Judiciary Committee suspended the investigation late last year at Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange  request. Strange said the committee  work overlapped with work done by his office.Bentley said Monday he was “aware” of some investigations into his office but maintained that he has done nothing wrong.“There have been rumors and innuendos and foolishness,” Bentley said Monday. “Nobody in my office, past or present, has done anything illegal or unethical. I have never done anything illegal or unethical, and I am eager to say that.”PrisonsBentley made his comments after speaking to the Alabama Sheriffs Association’s Winter Meeting. The governor discussed the possibility of added training for law enforcement to deal with mental illness, and his proposal to replace the state’s prisons with new, larger facilities, noting that state prisoners are often housed in local facilities due to overcrowding.Buy PhotoAs the Advertiser’s Brian Lyman reported, numbers of corrections officers assigned to state prisons have been in long-term decline and fell steeply from 2,042 in September 2015 to 1,627 in September 2016, a 20 percent drop.  Photo: Mickey Welsh/Advertiser “Overcrowding right now is our worst problem, and we’re going to try to remedy that with legislation,” he said.The governor has considered a special session with the regular legislative session – which begins Feb. 7 – to push his prison construction proposal. Bentley Monday said he will see what the chances for the legislation are in the regular session before moving to bring legislators into a special session.The prison construction proposal will be the one Bentley and Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner Jeff Dunn pushed early last year, envisioning three men’s facilities with 4,000 beds each and a smaller women’s facility. Bentley said the proposal will also incorporate design-build – in which a single entity controls design and construction.That bidding process, along with an $800 million price tag, made many legislators uneasy. An altered version of the proposal failed on the final night of the 2016 legislative session. The governor said “there will be explanations to our legislators” about what the administration says are possible savings from the proposal.General FundBentley said he was looking forward to the start this year’s session, saying the General Fund budget proposal for the 2018 fiscal year was “the best budget I’ve had in six years.”“We’re funding our Medicaid; we’re doing some things I will announce in our State of the State address,” he said.Legislators are waiting to see what the Trump administration and Congress will do with federal funding, which Alabama relies on, particularly for Medicaid which plays a critical role in maintaining the health care sector in the state. Congress has discussed the possibility of turning Medicaid into a block-grant program for the states, which could limit funding.Bentley, who outlined his health care priorities to Congress in a Jan. 13 letter, sounded wary about that approach Monday. The governor said he told members of Congress last week that if Congress approves block grants, the states would need more power to control the program.“Just saying block grant – that’s kind of a buzz word,” he said. “You have to make sure you have enough money.”The governor also wants to maintain intergovernmental transfers and provider taxes, both crucial to Alabama Medicaid’s operations.“I’m not being critical about Congress, but they’re not boots on the ground,” he said. “They don’t manage Medicaid. They pass laws, but we’re the ones who put it into effect. We’re the ones who deal with it in our states. Congress doesn’t do that.”Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/2jQZ1DO
Man charged in explosion that damaged Boston police car                                                                      		 		           		         Crime scene tape and evidence markers in the area where a propane tank was placed under a Boston police cruiser.  WBZ-TV 	          								         		 		 		BOSTON  AP  – Police have charged a man they believe is responsible for a rush-hour bombing that damaged a Boston police cruiser but caused no serious injuries. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said Sunday he doesn’t know the motive of the Friday morning rush-hour explosion. He says a device deliberately left under the vehicle went off by itself. Police arrested 42-year-old Asim Kieta on Saturday night. The charges include possession of an explosive device and assault with intent to murder. The explosion occurred near a South Boston police substation. Evans says a second explosion involving the same device occurred after officers moved the vehicle. He says some officers may have suffered minor injuries. Evans says surveillance video helped police track down Kieta. Evans says Kieta grew up in Boston and is homeless.❤Police have arrested a 42-year-old homeless man in connection with an explosion that damaged a Boston police cruiser, but caused no serious injuries.                                                                 The near-tragedy occurred Friday morning outside a police substation in South Boston. A passing officer spotted a fire burning near the cruiser and moved the vehicle. Two explosions were heard soon afterward.                                                                Boston Police Commissioner William Evans told the Boston Herald that investigators believe the device involved a propane tank and possibly some fireworks.                                                                The Herald reported that Asim Kieta, formerly of Dorchester, Mass., was arrested Saturday night while sitting in his car in Charlestown. Surveillance video purportedly shows the suspect walking to and from the police substation Friday morning before getting in his car and driving away.                                                                 Kieta faces charges of possession of an explosive device, assault with intent to murder, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, assault and battery on a police officer and arson of personal property.                                                                We have who we believe is responsible,  Evans told reporters Sunday.  As far as motive goes, that  something we're still looking at.                                                                 Evans added Herald that he is in discussions with the FBI about potential federal charges being brought against Kieta.❤BOSTON, MA - OCTOBER 30: A Boston Police car is seen Lansdowne St. before Game Six of the 2013 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals at Fenway Park on October 30, 2013 in Boston, Massachusetts.  Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images   Boston police have arrested a man they believe is responsible for an explosion that damaged a police cruiser.  Asim Kieta, 42, was arrested without incident Saturday evening and has been charged with possession of an explosive or destructive incendiary device, assault with intent to murder, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, assault and battery on a police officer, and arson, according to a press release from the Boston Police Department.  During a press conference Sunday morning, Police Commissioner William B. Evans said Kieta has a lengthy criminal history.   Whether there  a hatred of police because of his past behavior or whether there is some nexus to what  going on in the world as far as terrorism or what happened yesterday with the demonstrations, we're not clear on the motive,  Evans said.  A propane tank planted next to a Boston police car caused the vehicle to catch fire Friday in what appears to be a deliberate attempt  to blow up one of our cruisers,  law enforcement officials said.  A police representative said the tank was wedged between the cruiser and a bridge on West Broadway in South Boston, near a Boston police station.  When an officer got into the cruiser and began driving, the tank exploded, Evans said.   Luckily, nobody was hurt,  Evans said.  Clearly, we're looking at this as a deliberate act.   Officials are still piecing together what caused the explosion. Evans said investigators believe the propane tank was combined with  maybe some type of explosive or fireworks on top that might have been the initial bang.   Police on Saturday released images of the suspect from the scene that were pulled from surveillance footage from a nearby business, police spokeswoman Rachel McGuire said.  The incident is still under investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, Boston police and the FBI.  Kieta will be arraigned Monday morning in South Boston District Court. It is not immediately clear whether he has an attorney.  Copyright 2017 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved.

A tornado possibly touched down Saturday evening  Jan. 21  south of Natchitoches, La., damaging as many as 18 homes and several vehicles, according to the Natchitoches Parish Sheriff  Office. Officials are waiting to hear back from the National Weather Service on whether a tornado did indeed form, though signs of damage indicating a tornado were apparent in images provided by residents, the sheriff  office said in a Facebook post on Sunday. In the post, the sheriff  office said officials believe between 10 and 18 homes were damaged, along with vehicles, outbuildings and downed trees during a storm Saturday that likely produced a tornado. The tornado possibly touched down just around 6 p.m. in Natchez and Point Place, south of Natchitoches. Deputies were handing out tarps to residents with storm-damaged roofs and, at one point, sent out a boat to retrieve items for a homeowner that were swept into the nearby Cane River Lake. That lake remained closed to boat traffic as of about 5:30 p.m. Sunday.  Strong storms on Saturday and Sunday killed several people across Georgia and Mississippi, including four killed by a tornado that touched down early Saturday in Hattiesburg, Miss. In all, 18 people have so far been reportedly killed by storms that tore through the Southeast on Saturday and Sunday, along with scores of injuries and flattened homes. Seven people were killed when a tornado destroyed a mobile home park in rural Cook County, Ga. Though spared damage from weekend storms, the New Orleans area was kept under a tornado watch from Friday night to Saturday night, as a line of thunderstorms rolled through the state and into Mississippi. Portions of West Feliciana and Pointe Coupee parishes were put under a tornado warning briefly Friday night. A gale warning was issued by the weather service Sunday afternoon for parishes in southeastern Louisiana, lasting through Sunday night.

N❤PHOTOS: Deputies say man had to cling to tree as tornado destroyed his Natchez home  NATCHITOCHES – Authorities in Natchitoches Parish say multiple people were hurt Saturday after a possible tornado damaged homes near Natchez Louisiana.  Around 6:03 p.m. Saturday, authorities discovered significant damage to homes off La. Hwy 494 in Natchez and near Cane River Lake in Point Place.  Officials say two people were transported to the Natchitoches Regional Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries. Others suffered minor injuries and bruises.  “One man in Point Place was sucked out of his brick home through the front door and thrown in his front yard,” the statement from NPSO said. “The home received heavy damage.”  Deputies say another man was lying in bed in his mobile home when a tornado destroyed his home and threw debris into Cane River Lake. The man was able to crawl out of the home and hold on to a tree while the storm passed.  “At this time, deputies believe 10-18 homes in the area were damaged by the possible tornado,” NPSO said.  A survey will have to be completed by the National Weather Service to confirm whether the damage was caused by a tornado. NPSO said it appears from images taken by private citizens during the storm that it was a tornado.  Sunday, deputies offered assitance to residents and distrubted tarps to residents suffering roof damage.
A truck spill in Wisconsin has led Mars Inc. to launch an investigation into the curious details.  The incident happened on Tuesday night in Dodge County, Wisconsin—when the local Sheriff’s Office was called to clean up “hundreds of thousands” of red Skittles that had poured onto the street, giving the roadway a pinkish tint and filling the air with a distinct sugary smell. Sheriff Dale Schmidt posted photos of the candy-covered road on Facebook—originally stating that authorities “don’t know who did this.” Later, he updated the post to report the candies had spilled from a pickup truck and were intended to be used as cattle feed.  “The Skittles were confirmed to have fallen off the back of a truck. The truck was a flatbed pickup and the Skittles were in a large box. Due to it raining at the time, the box got wet and gave way allowing the Skittles to spill out on the roadway,” wrote Schmidt. “It is reported that the Skittles were intended to be feed for cattle as they did not make the cut for packaging at the company.”  The sheriff joked of the candy spill, “In the end these Skittles are actually for the Birds!”  A representative for Mars Inc. told PEOPLE the company is looking into the incident, and why these candies were intended to be fed to cattle. The company said that while they do sell unused products for animal feed, the plant in Yorkville, Illinois—where these particular Skittles were produced—does not. “This was product that could not be finished due to a power outage at our factory. It was intended for destruction,” a Mars representative said. “We are investigating what happened and we hope to know more soon.”  For more breaking food news, follow People Food on Facebook.  Josh Cribbs, a cattle nutritionist and director of commercial development for the American Maine-Anjou Association, told the Associated Press that varying unused food products are often repurposed for cattle after they are mixed with other ingredients. These Skittles—which were missing the letter ‘S’ on them—for instance, were likely melted down into a syrup.  WATCH THIS: How to Make Candied Apples with Candy Corn  “You might think, ‘Oh my gosh, [the cattle] might be eating a Skittle.’ In reality, that piece of candy is being broken down,” said Cribbs.  A representative for Mars Inc. did not immediately respond to PEOPLE for further comment.❤It looks like a bunch of cows were going to “Taste the Rainbow” or at least part of the rainbow. A bunch of Skittles spilled on a road in Wisconsin, and they’re now under investigation.  This story is just plain weird, and it keeps getting weirder. It all started when a Wisconsin sheriff posted on Facebook that “hundreds of thousands of Skittles” had spilled on a rural road, according to the Associated Press. Oddly enough, only red Skittles spilled. A deputy came across the mishap and sent the photos to Sheriff Dale Schmidt. The sheriff later updated his post to explain that the candies were on their way to be cattle feed.  Apparently, there was a power outage at the factory when the candy was created so they never got their “S.” Because of this, they weren’t supposed to be sold. Mars spokeswoman Denise Young says the batch was scheduled to be destroyed. Now the company is investigating.  It’s not abnormal for leftover food products, especially candy, to become cow feed. The odd thing is that the Mars factory where the candy came from doesn’t sell its unused product for cow feed.  “We don’t know how it ended up as it did and we are investigating,” a spokesperson for Mars said.  According to the company, you should worry about the cattle getting a sugar high or not getting their nutrition. The company’s corporate environmental manager, Linda Kurtz, says the candy particles go in with other ingredients to make animal food. She also says Mars doesn’t sell straight to farmers, which is even odder considering where the candy was headed.  We guess even cows need some colorful candy from time to time.

It  been about a week since a tornado touched down in Whitney and damaged property all over the city-- but today -- some people in the community came together for worship.  Hundreds of people gathered at the Open Range Cowboy Church for church service, even though the church suffered a lot of damage during the tornado that came through Whitney on Jan. 15.  “We’ve been through a lot of storms in the past and avoided any damage, but this time we did take a hit” said Terry Mason, church elder.  The tornado tore off part of the roof, busted out windows, and broke down doors, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of damage to the  Cowboy Church. But after the storm, members got together to try to pick up the pieces.   Just in a matter of a few minutes, we probably had 50 or 60 people here securing the building,” said Mason.  We secured the doors, the windows that were blown out, [and] we took own all the loose meal that was blown away.   Mason said they worked all week to make sure the congregation could meet for church on Sunday.   [We wanted to] give the people that had had a rough week -- had a rough night that night -- [we wanted to] give them a place to come this morning to be at church.   Associate Pastor Rick Pinner says although the church’s building is damaged, its body is still intact.   Our building was torn up, [but] the church is our people. It is not this building,  Pinner said.  Our building is just a very small part of what we do...this church is a body of Christ in this community,  he added.  Pinner says about 600 people showed up to the morning service, although the church is facing $200,000 worth of repairs.❤It  been about a week since a tornado touched down in Whitney and damaged property all over the city-- but today -- some people in the community came together for worship.

Hazmat crews are working to identify and clean-up a suspicious substance in central Fresno.Fresno firefighters were alerted to the area of Wishon and Weldon Avenues around 11 a.m. after someone spotted a white liquid following into a storm drain.Crews took precaution and Hazmat personnel were called in to identify the material. During the first test, results came back inconclusive but firefighters say it looks to be something that could be used for painting. We're going to take all appropriate measures and assume that this stuff is bad for you. So, it means that we're going to be as cautious as we can and that  a good thing for the public,  Batt. Chief Lawrence French with the Fresno Fire Department said.Wishon was closed for several hours during the clean-up. City Flood Control and county environmental crews were also called on scene to determine the best way to clean-up the substance while determining if it could impact nearby residents.❤Two hazardous materials teams, the fire department and police were called out to investigate a strange opaque substance found in a storm drain in Fresno on Sunday.A call came in from a man around 11 a.m. Sunday about the whitish-blue matter in a puddle outside a drain on Wishon and Cambridge avenues, said Fresno Fire Battalion Chief Lawrence French.Crews tried three different tests to figure out what the substance was but have not been successful. They do say it does not pose any danger and is not toxic. French describes it as similar to water, “as if you washed a paintbrush or a roller in the sink with water-based paint,” he said.The substance flowed south to the drain on Normal Street but did not go any further.Any of the substance that did get through the drain will end up in a ponding basin where Fresno Metropolitan Flood Control District and the Fresno County Environmental Health agency will discuss how to remove it, said French.Wishon is expected to be closed from Cambridge Avenue to Normal Street until crews finish, but it is not known how long that will be.
