# DSEndeavors

This is to keep all the data science endeavors on public datasets, personally or at work.

## Major projects:

#### 1. Predictive coding experiments on Enron Email dataset: pick out emails related to fantasy football. 
This is a series of pratice that covers a lot of machine learning classifiers, concepts in text analysis, and implementation with scikit-learn, gensim, etc. Topics covered include:

* Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes classifier, RandomForest, SVM, PCA
* Text analysis: regular expression; Bag-of-words, td-idf, word2vec, LSA; 
* Python implementation: sklearn - metrics, Pipeline, GridSearch, CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer, PCA; gensim - word2vec; re 

#### 2. Deduplicate news articles
This is a script I create at work for our internal news feeds - a simple yet working solution for an unsupervised task that I'm very proud of.

* Customize tfidf - coding up tfidf on named entities from scratch (numpy; spaCy for NER)
* Model similarity matrix as a graph (networkx)!

#### 3. CNN on sentence classification
